    <h3>Introduction</h3> 

    <p>This file contains documentation on the ACE 2004 Multilingual Training Corpus, Linguistic
    Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2005T09 and isbn 1-58563-334-8.

    <p>This publication contains the complete set of English, Arabic and Chinese
training data for the 2004 Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) technology
evaluation.  The corpus consists of data of various types annotated for
entities and relations and was created by Linguistic Data Consortium with
support from the ACE Program, with additional assistance from the DARPA
TIDES (Translingual Information Detection, Extraction and Summarization)
Program.  This data was previously distributed as an e-corpus (LDC2004E17)
to participants in the 2004 ACE evaluation.</p>

<p>The objective of the ACE program is to develop automatic content extraction
technology to support automatic processing of human language in text form.
In September 2004, sites were evaluated on system performance in six areas:
Entity Detection and Recognition (EDR), Entity Mention Detection (EMD), EDR
Co-reference, Relation Detection and Recognition (RDR), Relation Mention
Detection (RMD), and RDR given reference entities. All tasks were evaluated
in three languages: English, Chinese and Arabic.</p>

<p>The current publication consists of the official training data for these
evaluation tasks.  A seventh evaluation area, Timex Detection and
Recognition, is supported by the ACE Time Normalization (TERN) 2004 English
Training Data Corpus (LDC2005T907). The TERN corpus source data largely
overlaps with the English source data contained in the current release.</p>

<p>A complete description of the ACE 2004 Evaluation can be found on the ACE
Program website maintained by the <a href="http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/ace/">National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST)</a>: <a href="http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/ace/">http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/ace/</a></p>
