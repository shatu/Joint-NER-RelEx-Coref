A: so we're supposed to be talking about how september eleventh has
changed our lives
B: yes
A: how did it ef- affect you in north carolina
B: well i don't know about other north carolinians uh the the effect on
me has just been the secondary effect of making air travel
B: a lot
B: less convenient
A: mhm
B: because of security
A: mhm
B: but i don't think it's changed my attitudes i don't walk around with
any more or less fear of flying or anything else
A: mhm
A: what about when you're on an airplane
B: um
A: do you pay anymore attention to the other travelers
B: i don't
B: i don't really i i certainly have the
B: you know i go on an airplane with the attitude that if anybody starts
messing around you're going to have to
A: uh huh
A: mhm
B: but now i don't think passengers would would ever permit it in fact i
don't believe there's been a successful hijacking since
B: september eleventh
A: oh that's true i hadn't thought about that course they didn't happen
all that frequently anyway
A: but
A: yeah cause before the
A: the
A: what the prominent
A: thought was that if you cooperate then less people will be killed
B: yeah
A: and let the
A: authorities take care of of the situation but that's certainly not
the case anymore
B: yeah
A: plane
B: mhm
A: and their pot-
A: potential i guess
A: for um
A: for causing damage
B: yeah
A: but it has made air travel a lot
A: less convenient
A: that's true
B: yeah it it has in in
B: act- in one sense it has it was another sense i realized because uh
B: uh i do quite a bit of air traveling my wife does a tremendous amount
because she's a corporate executive uh
A: mhm
A: mhm
B: an uh uh international
B: corporation
B: it's a lot easy to get flights cause a lot of people for months and
months after september eleventh didn't fly
A: uh huh
B: and you just call up
B: a day in advance and you can get a flight that ordinarily you'd have
to
B: make reservations
B: weeks or months in advance for
A: oh really
B: so i guess that was a
B: i don't know whether to call that a good thing or not
A: well it certainly was not good for the airline industry
B: no
A: and i think
A: a side effect of that has been
A: the new changes that they've made made for travel um
A: a month ago i was supposed to go down to south carolina to visit a
friend
A: and her dad had open heart surgery
A: unexpectedly
A: and so i wanted to change my
A: plans and before i could just call the airline and change my flight
now i have to call
A: the day of my departure if i call after midnight on the day of my
departure i've lost the ticket totally and it cost me a hundred
dollars to make the change the ticket itself was
A: um less than two hundred dollars so i added fifty percent to the
price of the ticket just so that i wouldn't lose what i had paid for
it
B: ouch
B: was that southwest by any chance
A: no that was uh
A: i don't remember
A: who it was
B: mhm
B: interesting
A: well i don't remember cause i really don't have loyalty to one
particular
A: airline it's whoever can get me the cheapest price
B: yeah
B: ha- have you been to new york since uh 
A: no
B: nine eleven
A: not not new york city
A: upstate new york yes but not new york city
B: yeah
A: so i haven't visited the site at all
B: yeah i felt like i
B: wanted to see the site and also go there and
B: uh basically go there and spend some money in the city they took
B: they took such a beating and uh
A: that's true
B: so uh
B: my wife and i went up there in october maybe a month or five weeks
later
A: oh yeah
B: and it was
B: well let's just say it was an interesting and unique experience to be
on that site and see the kinds of things that were going on and uh
A: mhm
B: the kinds of messages people left and the reaction of people and
B: i mean you know it's just something that
B: that
B: most people will read in history books and they'll never have
experienced it
A: right yeah it was probably somber there
B: it was pretty somber yeah somber would be exactly the right word
A: i've been to the
A: memorial in oklahoma city
B: mhm
A: for the murrah building and i would imagine that it would be a
similar
A: atmosphere
A: at both places
B: yeah how long after that
B: bombing did you go
A: w- let's see
A: it was it was on the anniversary of the bombing
A: i do not remember it was in ninety
A: ninety nine that i went
A: how many years would that have been
B: i you know i i mean i certainly remember the bombing but the date you
know it's not affixed to a date in my memory the way nine eleven is
A: yeah
A: well that's how they kept referring to it as september eleventh
B: yeah
A: the the media used that date so often
B: yeah
A: when referring to it
B: yeah
B: i didn't know if i had a
B: kid born if i was a kid born on the date well it's hard to say by the
time maybe five or six years from now people won't talk about it that
much
A: yeah but the thing too with the oklahoma city bombing it was one
event
B: yeah
A: and on september eleventh and one event in one city september
eleventh it was new york city and washington ~dc and pennsylvania
B: yeah
B: yeah
B: yeah
A: so
A: you would ha- kind of have to refer to it as the date
B: yeah that's right
A: because of the
A: breadth
A: of what of what they did
B: yeah
A: one thing
A: in maryland we can get into ~dc pretty easily and you certainly see
some changes there
A: now after the bombings
B: mhm
A: in africa the terrorist bombings in africa
B: mhm
A: then that's when barriers went up
A: around most of the buildings but after september eleventh even more
barriers went up
B: right
B: right
A: around them to try to stop i guess truck bombs
A: things like that
B: yeah are are you in the sort of the ~dc metro part of maryland
A: um i'm between baltimore and maryland so no not really i'm i'm kind
of north of that
A: but but
A: the um tours of the white house
A: are totally
A: stopped now except for school groups
A: or before if you were willing to stand in line you could go on a tour
of the white house and now
A: you just can't
B: yeah
B: hm
A: that's one thing i i'm not sure about tours of uh
A: congressional
A: buildings or being able to go in and watch congress
A: whether that's changed or not
B: yeah i don't know they certainly i'm sure that to get
B: even close you have to (( ))
B: undergo a pretty uh pretty extensive search
A: mhm
B: i should think yeah
A: yeah getting into other public buildings like the smithsonian museums
A: i think they're still the same
A: although it used to be one guard that was there checking your bags
and now they have three or four
B: mhm
A: i don't know whether that's for safety's sake or just because more
people are
A: were there when i went
A: but it hasn't really changed my habits at all
A: similar to what you said earlier
B: yeah i certainly think about it but it's uh
B: and it's affected my life in a psychological kind of a way
A: yeah
B: this sort of
B: i mean it does i think it really did change the way everybody looked
at
B: at the world or for people who took
B: take the trouble to look at it from an international perspective
anyway
