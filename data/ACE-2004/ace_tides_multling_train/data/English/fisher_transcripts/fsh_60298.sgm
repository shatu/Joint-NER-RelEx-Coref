B: and eh i've been married for twelve years 
B: um 
B: i know what
B: basically 
B: uh i think would be 
B: good qualities for a life partner
B: but in a 
B: but of course i'm just speaking for a male 
B: do they want 
A: oh i i i don't know (( )) 
B: for male and female
A: i think they want us to talk mostly um 
A: well that's a very interesting question though is it is it 
A: is it really different from 
A: that is to say 
A: you know man looking for 
A: certain qualities of a woman and a woman looking for certain
qualities in a man are the the same 
A: qualities going to be the ones that 
A: that end up make making for 
A: successful partnership 
B: well i guess it's traditional qualities versus 
B: uh what people may look for now 
A: oh well that's a that 
A: that's an interesting can of worms what do you see as being the
traditional qualities
B: well traditional for a male might be ability to earn money 
B: or strength 
B: or 
B: um 
A: all those sort of 
B: yeah the 
A: socially and biologically conditioned things 
B: yeah 
B: uh 
B: whereas now women tend to look for men who 
B: may be more caring 
B: uh not so much financial because they're able to earn money
themselves
A: i see 
A: yeah 
A: yeah 
B: where there have been 
A: that's an interesting
B: well there's been changes in that 
A: sure 
A: there certainly have
A: um 
A: that's intere- cause i i mean i was going to the the first thing that
came came into into my head
A: uh 
A: was 
A: that 
A: what 
A: what 
A: ultimately 
A: seems to matter is 
A: some sort of shared values 
A: you know that you that you're not looking past 
A: past one another for uh 
B: yeah similarities 
A: yeah 
B: similarity in background maybe 
B: to make it a little bit easier to understand
A: yeah i suppose so uh 
B: excuse me 
A: i mean i wou- wouldn't wouldn't want to rule out the possibility of
of getting along well with someone from 
A: from a different background but 
B: well 
A: some 
A: some sort of commonality 
A: i mean 
A: you know some sort of commonality along with the differences you know 
B: yes 
B: well that makes perfect sense
B: and in fact that's 
B: i think why traditionally 
B: people always married within their
B: neighborhood or social group or whatever
A: mmm
B: and they don't do that so much anymore now 
A: well yeah i mean 
A: lots of 
A: lots of things enter into that i guess more mobility 
A: just physical 
A: mobility right i mean people don't
B: oh sure
A: people used to (( )) go go back far enough and you don't have to go
back very far people used to sort of 
A: generally speaking be born and and died within
A: thirty miles of the same 
A: spot
A: (( )) 
B: sure
A: kind of thing that doesn't happen (( )) i know i've
A: i would never have
A: met 
A: my wife if i hadn't been transported across the continent from where
i was born and and 
A: and that sort of thing
B: were you in college together 
B: or 
B: oh okay 
A: i mean i was still living in the town where i had gone to school so 
A: so that was a fact- that was certainly a factor in 
B: what qualities did you admire in her 
A: oh the sixty four dollar question 
A: i don't know i mean 
A: partly it was the we we we had com- common common interests
A: we're both musicians
B: mhm 
A: um 
A: uh partly it was the i mean she seems a very 
A: very very decent sort of type
B: yeah i kind of know all about that too i have one of those myself 
A: (( )) 
A: yeah yeah 
A: (( )) 
A: so uh 
A: yeah that 
B: and it's funny the things also that you look for in 
B: the beginning of a relationship  
B: sometimes you almost uh realize by accident 
B: the longer you're in a relationship 
B: those qualities that you may have overlooked 
A: yeah 
A: i think we may have had some of these (( )) 
A: same experiences you know as as you as you go down the road you 
A: you uh 
A: you realize what is the road that your you've been going down 
A: sort of thing 
B: mhm 
B: you didn't tell me any qualities besides those two
A: oh let's see which which ones were those
B: how about traditional qualities
A: traditional qualities uh
A: you mean the things that sort of appeals to the the hunter gatherer
gatherers slash uh corpora- uh uh gray flannel suit uh type uh
A: type guy 
A: well let's see um 
A: oh gosh but i'm not that kind of guy you know but but no she was not
not bad looking i mean as far as that goes there was a physical
attraction
B: but you know i 
B: i would bet that somewhere in those recesses are those
A: oh yeah i mean my reptile my reptilian brain is still in good
A: good shape you know
B: yeah 
A: (( )) the early primate is is in their working too 
A: but 
A: i don't know as i as as i see think about it i i i'm i'm thinking
about this question shared values shared backgrounds differen-
A: different
A: background and i i i think eh i think maybe part of 
A: part of it was was that 
A: her background was just enough different from mine that it it sort of 
A: filled in 
A: things that i i missed out on in in in my life i mean she came from a
very large family i came from a very small family 
B: mhm 
A: for example 
B: well i had looked for a 
A: what yeah you was going to say what
A: what what qualities 
A: what qualities gr- grabbed you 
B: well 
B: to be very honest well of course my husband is is i i always thought
he was very good looking 
B: um 
B: he'd been married before and had a child so 
B: i knew what his parenting abilities were
B: appreciated that 
A: oh 
B: and uh 
B: believe it or not the thing that i liked most about him was that he
could fix things around the house 
A: oh 
A: that's a very attractive quality 
B: very attractive 
A: i have to confess my spouse possesses it in in abundance whereas i'm
not 
A: permitted to play with sharp objects
A: because basically anything that doesn't have an undo key 
A: i'm hopeless at
B: then your wife has that
B: ability to control a situation and and that's a very good quality 
A: oh yeah oh yeah 
B: she knows when to say no 
A: no she's very good at that sort of thing actually very very very
level headed i i think i think that that was the quality that 
A: ((  )) i somehow consciously or otherwise knew i needed 
A: um (( )) 
B: yeah you look for something that
A: yes
B: may be a piece that you're missing 
A: compli- complimentary qualities that 
B: yeah 
A: that sort of thing 
B: i wasn't sure how long we're supposed to talk 
A: i'm shuffling through the document here trying to trying to look but
but i think they will beep us when when (( )) 
B: oh okay 
A: when the time comes
B: i didn't read my papers
B: that's one thing i 
A: i haven't read them for a while
