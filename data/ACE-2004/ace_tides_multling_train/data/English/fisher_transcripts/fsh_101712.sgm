B: i don't know i- i don't really have much an opinion on it i think um 
B: a workplace has the right to 
B: drug test i don't know if they should be allowed random drug test
B: but i think
B: you know it's it's pretty much general practice now you know 
B: how do you feel about it 
A: i think it's an invasion of my privacy
B: do you really like even on the onset of a hire 
A: yep
A: i do
B: why is that
A: i'm fifty three years old 
A: and 
A: i think it's none of their damn business number one 
A: unless i'm driving machinery
B: that's true
A: you know i um
A: i actually was offered a job with the veteran's administration
hospital 
A: and i was running a computer and
A: i went through a lengthly hiring process nothing was ever said about
drug testing
A: i filled out
A: i was hired i fi- i then filled out the eight page application and
the very last thing and it took me you know 
A: a couple of days of interviews and um
A: whatever and and then the ah 
A: oh i don't know maybe two hours being processed and then they said
and now it's time for your drug test and i looked at them and i said
i beg your pardon
A: ((and he said)) it's time for your drug test he- here's your cup and
i said 
A: drop dead
B: yeah
A: i said you have to be kidding me i said i'm fifty years old you think
i'm peeing in a cup for you 
A: get real
A: i said if you want me you call me
A: and i went home
B: did they hire you
A: absolutely 
B: wow
B: i've never actually been tested for drugs all the jo- jobs that i've
ever had never tested so

B: but i guess i have nothing to hide so i don't really 
B: you know ever 
B: personally i-
A: i have nothing to hide either 
B: yeah
A: but i don't think that it's it's like saying are you a homosexual do
you have children when i was 
B: yeah
A: young
A: very young eighteen maybe
B: yeah
A: i was being interviewed 
A: now let's see how long ago would that have been nineteen sixt-
A: sixty eight sixty nine i was being interviewed for a job and they
asked me if i was married if i was engaged if i lived with anybody if
i had children if i was planning on having children 
A: now
A: that's against the law
A: it's against the law
B: it is against the law
A: it's against the l-
B: you're not allowed to ask those questions (())
A: they asked my age they asked what my intentions were i mean it was
insane the questions they asked me
B: yeah
A: and
A: i didn't take the job
A: i i decided i didn't wa- 
B: you could've sued
A: you know well at the time i was eighteen i didn't know anything
within two years i knew better
B: yeah
A: but at eighteen i didn't know
A: and believe me in nineteen sixty eight um there were bigger fish to
fry i was kind of busy with other things
B: yeah it's true
A: and um
A: i thought
A: i want a summer job i'm making minimum wage 
B: yeah
A: are you serious
B: yeah
A: if i have children
A: get out of here
B: yeah
A: i'd sue their pants off today
B: yeah
A: i carry a small tape recorder with my with me now
B: during an interview
A: mhm
A: you bet ya
A: and if they start asking me questions i immediately whip it out and
say well i think that 
A: you shouldn't have any objection to my recording this 
B: yeah
A: and if they call an end to it they know
A: if they don't hire me 
A: they're in trouble 
A: if they do hire me
A: they're really going to regret having hired me
A: there's not a win win situation there for them 
B: so what do you do now like what's your line of work 
A: i am retired
B: oh cool
A: i am retired i'm disabled
A: and i um 
A: i have 
A: that that ~va job was the only job i was ever 
A: asked
A: for a drug test
A: and 
A: i looked at them and said you must be kidding 
A: and they said well this is the federal government and i said 
A: well this is jane thompson you're talking to 
A: who do you think you are and they said well i tested for it and i
said well good for you	
A: that's your privelage you want to go ahead and do that that's fine
but i'm not doing it if you want me to work for you you make up your
own mind
A: and i went home
A: and
A: i i was stunned that they would they would even pull that you know
A: um
A: i said if i work here 
A: for months and months and months and you think 
A: that i'm 
A: that i have a problem 
A: then
A: you can call me in and then we can discuss it
B: yeah
A: i said but if you're going to assume
A: that
A: i'm a drug user and i have to pee in a cup to prove i'm not 
A: then that's the wrong 
A: basis for a relation- a working relationship
B: yeah i think most pe- um places treat is as like a standard practice
B: so that most people will just you know have to do it without you know
A: well i'm never one to just go along with standard practices 
B: yeah i can tell 
A: it's not
A: it's just not 
A: and i think that that's what's wrong with ah with most people is that
they go oh well you know ah everybody does it  
A: ah you know i was taught when i was a kid that that was a stupid
thing 
A: i haven't changed my mind now that i'm a grown up 
B: (( ))
A: everybody does it
A: god that was like the worst excuse you could give to your parents
your teachers your priest your whoever 
B: yeah i think most people just
A: when you were a kid
B: you know
B: they deal with it they'll do anything you know to get hired they- you
know would you know rather choose c- you know less
B: confrontation as possible you know
B: but
A: yeah well
A: ((where's the pity))
B: yeah
A: ((more's to pity))
A: that's how we get into wars that's why people hate us around the
world yeah
A: yeah i think that that's really a problem
A: people are not empowered to stand on their own two feet and think for
themselves anymore
A: they aren't
B: we- i think most people would rather not you know it's easier to not
think at all you know what i mean
A: yes
A: i do
A: but anybody who
A: who looks back on their life
A: really you know you get to a certain age and you look back and you
say you know if only i had said no
A: somewhere
A: because ah y- it leads to more and more oh what the hell 
B: yeah
A: as you get older
A: and
A: you know it's re- it gets harder to say no as you get older
A: unless you have an epiphany where you go wait a minute 
A: wait a minute
A: i've had several epiphanies
A: several
A: i deal with the government a lot
A: when you're on disability you do
A: in order to get disability they asked me how many times a day i went
to the bathroom
B: wow
A: yeah
B: that's incredible
A: i left it blank
B: i imagine i would have i mean
A: i said why a- come on down and watch
B: i mean i don't count i don't know that's a ridiculous question
B: i haven't had much involvement with the government 
A: yeah
B: and then again i'm not very old so
A: and the thing is 
A: the government gets as big as people will allow it to 
B: yeah
A: and that's exactly what's 
A: gotten
A: happened with the drug testing
B: so what was the other part of the question i- something like um 
B: what do you think about them doing random drug tests was that the
