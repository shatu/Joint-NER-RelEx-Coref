B: (( )) anything back to normal
A: yeah i mean everything is back to normal it it's almost too back to
normal at this point i'm afraid
B: yeah
A: uh my feeling about a lot of this is that we've we've almost
forgotten what happened that day um
A: but uh you know everything that we said we were going to do 
A: uh on that day we really haven't done we haven't uh we're not i don't
feel like we're any safer uh than we were on that day and uh 
A: i feel like a lot of the the uh precautions and the the the changes
that people said they were going to make have re- really not happened
i don't know is that what's your perspective
B: uh i agree it's
B: it's slow but of course anything that
B: a large group
B: like the government would have to control is just so incredibly slow
and
B: and sometimes the things that
B: they plan just never actually happen so i
B: even though i understand that those things should probably be done
A: mhm
B: they don't have much faith that any of it will ever take place
A: yeah i know the feeling uh no- i'm not a big uh uh truster in the
government right now especially this government
B: yeah yeah i have uh definite doubts about it myself uh
B: how about personally
B: do you fear more than you used to
A: no not at all uh my wife does she
A: she (( )) she worries about a lot of stuff uh personally we're
A: we're leaving new york although i would like to believe that it has
nothing to do
A: geologically a safe place 
B: yeah
A: that things like hurricanes and tornadoes and earthquakes and things
like really didn't 
A: hit you here
A: uh we're moving to california where earthquakes and
A: tornadoes and things like that do hit you uh but our our 
A: our risk management uh beliefs have changed since september eleventh
obviously
B: well the nice thing is
B: yo- you know your enemy there
A: yeah
B: so that's 
B: (( )) 
B: people who've lived there all their lives could give you such
wonderful tips on on how to deal with everything and uh this was so
new nobody could ever do that
A: sure well and and my my feelings about th-
A: about accidents and these kinds of things is there's you just can't 
B: no you can't
A: live your life that way you know you can't prepare for these kinds of
things they uh they happen and they happen and you know i there's so
many stories
A: out of september eleventh
A: of not only people who are just
A: who died uh but people who lived and and those who lived
A: um
A: you know for for no reason for for because they were late to work or
uh you know because they took one elevator and it got stuck or or it
didn't and you just
B: mhm
A: and did you read any of this stuff in the in the times after it
happened about all those portraits of grief and uh you know there was
one women who was supposed to be flying on 
B: oh sure
A: uh united airlines flight eleven
A: and she couldn't get frequent flyer miles so she changed it she paid
for a flight
A: uh and she flew on
A: american airlines flight one seventy five instead
B: mhm
A: so she got off one of the planes that crashed
A: but 
A: booked a flight onto the other 
A: plane that crashed
B: yeah well you just have to figure that there's 
A: uh-huh
B: something mor- a little more at work there
B: and she was going to go
A: or or it's just complete
A: chance and that's you know you here
A: when when something momentous like this happens
A: you here about all kinds of coincidences
A: uh-huh whereas you don't here them on such a national scale
B: oh sure
A: uh you know and uh people i knew who uh i guy i knew got killed
A: because 
A: he came in 
A: uh he was quitting his job and he came in one last day
A: to you know to straighten up his office and make life uh easier for
his successor
B: wow
A: you know 
A: you know you can't
A: no what are you not going to do that uh you just
A: it's just impossible to live that way
B: oh sure
A: uh 
B: well if if you lived that way you'd never leave the house and you
would fear your house
A: exactly
A: yeah
A: yeah god knows what's in our household the asbestos and
B: yeah so it really doesn't it really doesn't pay i always kind of
think that
B: shit happens
B: and uh (( )) 
B: me and my husband
B: uh by december
B: uh 
B: he lost his job that the business had just plummeted
A: mhm
A: wow
B: and uh
A: what kind of business is he in
B: actually he's in 
B: uh clothing
A: uh-huh
B: within like formal wear and up in that area
B: they had just
B: cancelled absolutely everything 
A: sure
B: and 
B: no one dressed up and no one went to parties and
B: uh 
B: mean there were it was even doubtful that the next season ther- there
would actually be kids who were having proms
A: wow
B: there were just there were no orders at the time when there should
have been really big orders
B: so the day after christmas my husband lost his job
A: oh man
B: ah but
B: he he returned to philadelphia and so many things had moved from 
B: uh 
B: midtown down to philadelphia
A: no kidding
B: where people felt safer of course of course they've not walked the
streets of philadelphia at night so
A: really
A: yeah i was going to say i i haven't been to philadelphia in a long
time but i don't think of it as a particularly safe place
B: it's oh god it's
B: totally unsafe
B: but
B: yeah they perceived that it would be much safer to go there and uh so
B: my husband did find a
B: a better opportunity back down here
A: oh well that's good
B: yeah
A: so you're much closer to philadelphia than to new york
B: oh yeah where
B: about seven or eight minutes away from philadelphia
A: oh okay so just across the line there
B: yeah
A: uh yeah we traveled over that bridge
A: once uh is that the the walt whitman bridge
B: yeah yeah we're a
B: am kind of at the base of the walt whitman bridge but not at the
grungy base we're back a little further where it's a little nicer
A: oh okay i don't i don't know it particularly well i usually just go
straight up the turnpike but we uh we missed our our turn at one
point and went across (( )) 
A: two ninety five there
B: yeah
A: oh
A: and it's a nice bridge
B: yeah well
B: uh i think
B: you know
B: despite all the problems in new york
B: new jersey area the whole mid-atlantic area is just to me the perfect
place to live
A: uh-huh
B: because 
B: no matter where you need to go you can find something
A: right
B: and 
B: a
B: i guess it it there would never be a reason for me to leave even if
they
B: were to come in and do the same thing in philadelphia
A: right
A: or
B: and i and i do worry that my husband
B: you know because he's so close to the liberty bell and all those
areas there's constant threats
A: mhm
B: that i i i think i still worry as much as i did in the very beginning
A: uh-huh
A: really
B: yeah and i have a ten year old who now is afraid to fly
A: oh no
B: and he's flown everywhere
A: wow
B: and he's now he's afraid so we're getting his little butt back up on
the plane and
B: taking him some place as soon as possible 
A: he's afraid because of september eleventh
B: yeah well why wouldn't she be no matter what channel he put on
B: there were these images over and over and over again of
B: planes crashing into the world trade center
A: uh-huh
B: and you know for an impressionable nine year old that's 
B: i would think that that would uh
B: surely make a difference
A: oh absolutely was he home alone when it happened
B: no he was actually in school
A: oh
B: and i remember calling the school and saying you know
B: do i need to come and pick him up and they said well no he's really
safe here
A: right
B: and he doesn't know about anything if he was home he would know
A: well and he'd be watching even more ~tv and
