and ~msnbc
A: well yeah and
A: and fox
B: yeah why and fox
A: yeah
B: um
A: so
B: just mainly because you know there's kind of a different view slight
different view in some of the in

for me to
B: oh my good- that explains
A: really tell and everything

for the first time in a while cause if you watch that stuff it it
A: i yeah i can only take it so long
B: you know what i mean
A: i get
A: oh i just
A: get antsy i guess you might say
B: well i tell you what my cousin is is a is a marine in the very first
division over there
B: so he was one of the very first marines to go in in the tanks so it's
hard not to watch it but it's hard to watch it
A: uh huh
A: you know what's really unbelievable is
A: all the
A: i mean
A: that we're seeing all this on ~tv
A: i mean my
B: i know
A: my dad you know he was in the war his
A: brother was in the war
B: oh yeah
A: he was
A: killed over there
A: you know
A: i forget what war it was that he was in but
A: to think
A: that they would actually
A: um
A: um
A: were broadcast this
B: like a i was like live twenty four hours kind of thing
A: on ~tv
A: yeah i mean it's just
A: it's unbelievable cause they've never done this be-
B: yeah i know i think for history purposes that's really great
A: -for like this
A: and
A: it yeah it is
B: you know
A: but for families
B: right it's really hard
A: that have
A: families over there i i
A: don't know how they do it
B: yeah
A: i mean with all the cover-
B: i know because you know
B: like normally i've got one little girl and she's she's only nine
months old
B: dated you know with the news
A: mhm
B: and it's like you know what are we going to do you know but then
again i want to watch that you know so it's hard for me to kind of
A: exactly
B: to say okay we need to do something for her because i don't want her
watching that all the time i mean i know she's not old enough to
really pick up on it but
A: yeah she's not old enough to understand really what's going on
B: yeah
B: yeah but she still needs that other stuff you know
A: oh yeah
B: that um
B: yeah i did not know that though about the um executions i know that
they were blasted for showing 
B: something about the ~pow's but
B: like i was out of the house today so i didn't really catch a lot of
it
B: but um
B: good gracious did they they didn't say like who they were or anything
B: i know
A: it's hard to remember what you saw one day
B: it's hard to keep up with it and when it happened
A: yeah
B: cause it's it's because it's that (( )) coverage i think
A: yeah
B: you know it all goes together now but
A: and then they've got
A: days
A: got
A: two more because
B: oh yeah
B: was that the british the two that died today were british soldiers
A: well i don't i'm not
A: was there two that died today
A: i know that there was
B: um well no i saw it on there today i don't know 
B: i don't think it happened today the two british soldiers
A: (( ))
B: cause they were missing and they just assumed that they were
B: they had died
B: um and that went down because of the patriot missile that's what i
saw
B: so that was what was really sad about that cause that was like
B: good gracious
A: yeah
B: that that kind of stuff i mean i know that kind of thing
B: it it happens you know but good
B: grief
B: are you um are you for the war or against the war
A: mi-
A: i guess
B: yeah
A: i mean
B: it's hard to ever say you're for the war you know but
A: (( ))
A: yeah because
A: you know that there's just going be so many lives that are going to
be lost
B: yeah
A: and that's what the sad part is
B: i know
A: but
B: and scary yeah
A: i mean we do have to (( ))
A: (( ))
A: terrorism
B: i agree with that
A: i mean we really do
A: yeah
B: because they are much stronger now than they were twelve years ago
B: and they're they're
B: um
B: you know excuse the word but he seems to be even more of an evil
tyrant to me
A: yeah
B: you know
A: i would i
A: i just cannot imagine living
B: i know i mean it's
A: and if you talk
A: back
A: them
A: i mean
A: they're going to kill you
B: yeah it's it's
A: i mean you know
B: it's really hard to imagine
A: voice your own
A: opinion about him
B: yeah
B: and that's why a lot of these people um like as soon as the war
started the soldiers just turned themselves over they weren't even
they didn't even want to be fighting a lot of them
B: you know they're just pushed into that you know and um
B: i thought it was really uh good to see that some of these towns (( ))
they would come to the people would welcomed our soldiers you know
cause it's just as mixed an opinion probably over there as it is over
here
B: you know
A: i know i was list-
A: there was
B: mhm
A: shot and there was this
A: one
A: that was shot
A: and um
A: i don't know who the news reporter was i think i had it on ~msnbc and
A: they went over to him and
A: they let him
A: their phone
A: call his
A: let her know that he
B: uh huh
A: i'm sure his mother was just going ballistic
B: i know that's i think that's why they were so blasted you know by the
american government because what is it they said that was a um
B: it was like a breech of the geneva 
A: oh no-
A: well this
A: this was a ~us soldier and
A: it was
A: you know
A: being broadcast
A: by ~msn
A: they let him use their phone
B: oh okay okay
A: to call his mother
B: oh my gosh
A: but yeah the ones that you're talking about the geneva convention and
all yeah
B: yeah
A: um that's the ones i'm talking about where they've got a
A: them as prisoners of war and some of them were ex-
B: right
A: i mean not the ones
A: well i
A: it's the ones that went in that town and realized they took a wrong
turn
A: and they
B: oh
A: started to
A: double back
A: and that's when they ran in
B: mhm
B: you know and that
A: (( )) it was like eleven or twelve of them
B: yeah
B: well you know and that
B: there there video videoing or whatever their um executions that's
just that just goes to show you how horrible
A: yeah that's what
B: they are that's their fear tact- that's how they do their own people
though they scare their own people with things like that
A: yeah
A: yeah
A: (( ))
A: yeah
A: yeah
B: is
B: gives me chills because if you can just even imagine being a woman
over there
B: but to be a woman over there i would think that if i was a woman and
i had a daughter i would just cry
B: you know
A: uh huh
B: to know that i had to bring a daughter up in a society like that
B: i think we take that for granted over here
A: yeah we do
B: people forget that you know whether you agree or you disagree with
the war the soldiers that are fighting are fighting for you to have
the right to disagree you know
A: exact
A: and you know what
A: is
A: sort of ironic is all the
A: demonstrators that are against
B: yeah
A: they don't
A: they turn around they end up start-
A: fight
B: yeah i know
A: and
A: it's like i don't understand this here you're against a war but
you're standing there and you're fighting
B: yeah i know
A: that's the
A: i mean and since the war
A: same thing that
B: is kind of hypocrisy isn't it
A: what our men are doing
A: our's is doing it for a reason
B: yeah
A: and that is
A: (( ))
