A: oh i don't know too much about it to be honest with you about you
know uh i don't does
A: does anyone have the vehicle to get it here
B: well that's a i guess that's a big question you know but um uh you
know uh it just so happens that um 
B: uh i'm from uh my home is in trenton new jersey and that's where they
had the anthrax stuff and it doesn't take much just could be a letter
A: yeah
B: you know that 
A: that's true to to 
B: e- 
B: that it could be sent it and um you know you have letters going all
over the country to random um uh people i guess and they open it up
and 
B: uh uh and uh you know could contaminate a house it could contaminate
a family yeah 
A: yeah it's true that a whole household
A: people that's true 
B: yeah so i wonder 
B: uh uh i you know uh i i don't know how much of a threat it is 
B: but uh i guess one of the questions would be eh what you're
suggesting 
B: you know it's the delivery system 
A: mm 
A: like i'd wonder that about you know the state of the union address
last night 
B: yeah
A: about the saddam hussein 
A: eh does he is 
A: is he capable of getting anything over here
B: well 
A: like are his missiles i mean it's horrible enough everything he's
doing and i do think it's all bad
B: well i'm i'm very much against the war uh i mean yeah 
A: but
A: are you
B: i am i don't see the point 
B: there're so many other nations that are equally bad what are we going
to do all of them 
A: that is true i do think there are other 
B: you know where's it going to stop 
B: and if you know it seems to me we should be able to  
B: to um coerce him in other ways 
B: to um uh stop doing this stuff but you know we're we also have ah
bioterrorist stockpiles i mean what if we get a crazy person in our
our system
A: right
B: yeah what a- an employee it doesn't even have to be the president 
A: what do you do yeah it's true
A: right anybody 
B: you know this anthrax stuff had to come from somewhere 
A: yeah and you wonder how much other things they have stockpiled here 
B: yeah 
B: yeah well i don't know yeah 
A: i mean you know all with the intention i'm sure of making vaccines
and so on and so forth but 
A: but what all it you're right it takes one wacko who works there 
A: and who's to prevent 
A: somebody maybe with the bad intentions of intentionally getting that
job 
B: exactly and then you know it do- again it it 
B: -s um uh it doesn't take a lot doesn't take high tech you know it
isn't a matter of missiles you know it could be in um uh it could be
in a boat carrying oil
A: well that's true
B: um that ((duh)) comes into a port -n- and um has stuff so i think
it's a i think it's a serious problem and i don't know that there's a
a good way to stop it
B: you know just as we couldn't stop the world trade thing
A: yeah 
B: you know who whose who would figure 
A: right i don't yeah certain things are i don't know that there is a
way to stop 
B: yeah that i know even if they have intelligence you know if they
unless they have exact intelligence i don't know if it could be
prevented um
A: who'd have ever predicted that i don't know 
B: there's um 
B: you know there's always somebody who will find a way to defeat the
system 
A: oh yeah yeah well i think even the airport security thing 
B: yeah yeah 
A: and there are still people getting things on you know and some of it
i'm sure just a test to see how does it really work or not but my
goodness you think wow they've done all these things to prevent it
and it still doesn't work 
B: do you feel any sense of threat 
B: personally with these things or or are you just sort of saying well i
won't worry until it happens 
A: um 
A: i don't  
A: yeah sort of i mean only because i don't know that 
A: that if i spend a lot of my time worrying about it i can't 
A: particularly do anything about it at this point you know for my
immediate family you know i thi- so 
B: right
B: right 
A: for me to s- i guess i don't know for me to sit around and think
about it all the time and really worry about it 
B: yeah 
A: you know like couple of my neighbors are really concerned 
B: are they
A: yeah very concerned and 
B: do they have small children or no kidding are they uh are they from
here 
A: you know
A: no no they're older people 
A: well yeah yeah and 
A: yeah
A: yeah now i do have neighbors from um 
A: croatia 
B: mhm 
A: and  
A: they  
A: uh have a lot of concern they're not that much older but they have a
lot of concerns and 
B: right 
A: you know i said to be honest with you i just 
B: yeah 
A: i can't do anything today about it at all you know and i mean 
A: even as far as voting on something is not even available to do so for
me to
B: right
A: try you know i can't build a bomb shelter or something it's just not 
B: right 
A: in my day to day life 
B: right 
A: it doesn't impact me enough at this point what about you do you think
about it a lot 
B: no i eh because uh i feel the same way there's there is uh i mean
what are you going to do are you going to run for canada or are you
going to you know what uh
A: right
B: i mean uh what can you do 
A: it's true 
B: um 
B: uh i don't see that um 
B: you know i'm 
B: uh eh that there is there's anyway that the in- the individual
citizen can get involved in this and you have your intelligence
agencies but um you know
B: they're limited 
B: i mean how much how many billions of dollars you going to pour into
that 
A: yeah 
A: that's true too 
B: you know and um 
A: to get nowhere 
B: mhm 
B: yeah and y- you may or may not um be successful in preventing
something so um 
B: it's a scary world
B: i mean it's a very scary world we've got 
A: yeah 
A: it really is it's  
B: yeah um but you know i don't think the uh i don't think the nuclear 
B: thing i think bioterrorism is more of a problem than the nuclear
thing as a matter of fact 
A: yeah
A: i i think that's probably true 
B: because very few countries can hide nuclear 
B: stuff because a you need huge facilities to produce 
A: right
B: um the um uh 
B: the weapons grade 
B: uranium and those are pretty easy to spot 
A: mhm 
B: um 
B: and i- it's not something you can conceal in a shoe or whatever 
A: oh i didn't real- 
A: right right  
A: and i i guess since nuclear has been around for so long 
B: oh my 
A: i think you know in the sense that so they they hit you and you hit
them and and then everybody's gone so i mean really i think it maybe
keeps itself in 
B: right
A: check 
B: right 
B: yeah 
A: only because it's not something i mean if you do that to the wrong
person they certainly have the capabilities of retaliating and then
what good is it 
B: yeah 
B: but it was pretty let me tell you in in trenton it was pretty scary
when you 
B: you you start receiving mail that's sealed in little plastic packages
A: mm 
B: saying 
B: we believe this is irradiated 
B: but if you would like to and if you would if you don't uh want to
open it just put it in the garbage 
A: oh 
A: really 
A: huh 
B: and it was all sealed up and you you know you sit there and you look
at this thing and you say i don't even want to touch it 
A: right 
B: you know i don't even want to put my fingers on the plastic 
A: oh 
A: yeah cer- i don't that certainly i didn't realize that they would
they would actually you know 
A: tell you we think we've done we think we've
A: because they radiate it to kill it right
B: yes 
B: and supposedly that was done but they won't they won't put anything i
think on paper to guarantee that it was done 
A: ((what maybe stuff could work))
A: right 
B: i know it
A: and then you know unlucky you if it's not yours it didn't work on
B: so i just sa- i just saved those thing- 
B: i didn't even want to put it in the garbage  
B: you know i because i thought 
B: well 
B: you know 
B: what what if it it 
B: breaks open and then somebody else is exposed 
A: in the right 
A: yeah 
B: you know so 
B: here i have this thing sitting and i i took 
B: a couple of baggies 
B: safe 
A: yeah that that was really scary that 
A: you know of course you feel more there right in new jersey and
B: well you wonder you know you start looking you start looking around
and you say who the heck is in my neighborhood
A: you know and i hate to say any kind of um
A: like profiling and so on and so forth but you know
B: yeah 
A: if that's who's doing it then i guess there is a a profile needed
B: yeah 
A: if i call the police and say you know there's this chinese person
trying to get into my house 
A: i don't know that they're going to go look for everybody they're
going to go look for the chinese people
