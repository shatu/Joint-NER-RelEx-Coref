Lockerbie Trial Hears Terrorist 
</HEADLINE>

AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A Palestinian terrorist began his
testimony Friday in the trial of two Libyans accused of bombing Pan
Am Flight 103, describing his role in attacks against Israel in the
1970s. 

Mohammed Abu Talb, whose appearance at the special Scottish court
had been delayed for weeks, testified for the prosecution. He was
called in an effort to discredit the defendants' claim that his
group, the Palestine Popular Struggle Front, played a role in the
1988 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. 

Abu Talb, the last major prosecution witness, has been jailed in
Sweden for attacks against Jewish and American targets in Europe. He
has denied any involvement in the Lockerbie bombing, which killed
270 people. He admitted carrying out a terrorist attack in Denmark
in 1985 that killed a Jewish civilian. 

Defendants Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah
blame Abu Talb and other Palestinians for the 1988 attack. 

Prosecutors say the two defendants, who are alleged to be Libyan
secret agents, sent a suitcase from the Mediterranean island of
Malta carrying an explosives-laden cassette recorder and routed it
through Frankfurt, Germany, to the doomed airliner in London. 

Dressed in a plain dark suit and tie, Abu Talb was flanked by
Scottish prison guards as he took the witness stand, separated from
the public gallery by a wall of bulletproof glass. He was questioned
by prosecutor Alan Turnbull. 

The Egyptian-born Palestinian told judges that he deserted the
Egyptian army in the mid-1970s, fleeing to Lebanon via Jordan with a
false passport. He obtained a fake Moroccan passport before joining
the Palestine Popular Struggle Front in 1974. 

``I undertook various missions,'' 46-year-old Abu Talb said,
describing his terrorist past against Israel. ``In the beginning, I
was doing military operations, and then I went to security, after
which I was the special bodyguard of the secretary-general of the
organizations.'' 

The trial resumed this week after a month of delays following the
disclosure that new evidence surfaced on another group, the
Damascus-based Palestinian Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command. The PFLP-GC, like the PPSF, was initially
suspected in the Lockerbie attack. 

On Wednesday, Scottish judges asked Syria to hand over a document
that could help prove who blew up the New York-bound jetliner. 

Defense lawyer Bill Taylor said the document contains information on
German police raids of an alleged Palestinian terrorist base months
before the bombing. 

In the ``Autumn Leaves'' operation, police entered a PFLP-GC
hide-out in Neuss, Germany. They found an explosive device similar
to one that triggered the Pan Am explosion. The judges did not
explain what the requested document contained or how it came to be
in Syrian hands.
