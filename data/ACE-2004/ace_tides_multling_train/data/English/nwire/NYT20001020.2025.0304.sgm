INVESTORS FEEL EFFECTS OF MIDEAST VIOLENCE

In just two weeks this month, as investors worried whether the
violence in the Middle East would escalate into war, the stock
market in Israel fell 16 percent. In Egypt, the market dropped 20
percent. 

But for most American investors, many of whom buy their stocks
through mutual funds, the impact was more diffuse, though still
strong. While few investors own funds containing many Middle Eastern
companies, partly because there are not that many around to buy,
they nonetheless felt the effects of the region's volatility. 

Wall Street and other global markets were concerned that the
violence would translate into higher oil prices _ which it did,
briefly _ and that those prices, in turn, could lead to inflation
and higher interest rates. 

That line of thinking played a big role in the 379-point drop in the
Dow Jones industrial average and the 93-point drop in the Nasdaq
composite index on Oct. 12 _ the day that a Palestinian mob mauled
two Israeli soldiers, Israel retaliated with rocket attacks and
terrorists blew a hole in a United States warship in Yemen. 

Last week, Israeli and Palestinian leaders agreed to the terms of a
cease-fire after clashes in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. 

``For American investors, the oil effect was much more significant
than the direct effect on Middle East companies,'' said Grace
Pineda, who manages the $132 million Developing Capital Markets fund
for Merrill Lynch. The fund has about 5 percent of its money in
Israel and about 0.5 percent in Egypt. 

From late September, when the latest trouble erupted in the Middle
East, through last week, the broad markets and several categories of
mutual funds lost ground in the United States. In the most violent
period, Oct. 5 through 12, equity income funds were down 4.80
percent, according to Lipper Inc. Growth funds were off 7.79
percent, and growth-and-income funds 6.12 percent. 

Those funds generally do not contain shares of Middle Eastern
companies, yet the trouble in the region was among several factors _
along with a general sell-off in technology and telecommunications
stocks _ that brought down prices. 

Emerging-markets funds declined 7.17 percent over that period.
Although many of those funds invest in Middle Eastern companies, the
ripple effect of the threat to oil affected them most, analysts and
fund managers said. And those funds' investments in the region are
still relatively small, usually less than 10 percent of the
portfolios. 

``Most of the markets in the Middle East are insignificant in terms
of the amount of capital invested in them from the United States,''
said Mark Madden, manager of the $250 million Pioneer Emerging
Markets fund.'' 

Madden invests mainly in Mexico, Brazil and Korea. About 5 percent
of his portfolio is in Israel and less than 1 percent is in Egypt. 

Except during such tense times in the Middle East, analysts and fund
managers said, fluctuations in the United States markets, the
biggest and most dynamic in the world, are more likely to influence
share prices in the Middle East than vice versa. 

``The first thing overseas traders want to know when they come in in
the morning is, `What did the Nasdaq and the Dow do?''' said Howard
Klein, an institutional broker specializing in emerging markets at
SG Cowen Securities in New York. 

Traders in Israel in particular have their eyes on the Nasdaq. Their
country is also home to global technology, telecommunications and
pharmaceutical companies, which depend on economic currents in the
United States and Europe much more than on developments in the
Middle East. Shares of many Israeli companies are sold as American
Depository Receipts on the Nasdaq. 

Only a handful of small funds concentrate on the Middle East. One of
them, the $25 million American Israel Index mutual fund, is made up
exclusively of Israeli companies, 16 traded on the Tel Aviv exchange
and 19 on the Nasdaq. Like more broadly based mutual funds, its
shares fell during the recent turmoil. But its investors remained
confident. In the last few weeks, money flowing into the fund far
exceeded redemptions.
