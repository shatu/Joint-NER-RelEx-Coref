A majority of women, older voters, Democrats, liberals and black,
Hispanic and Asian voters cast their ballots for Al Gore. George W.
Bush captured the votes of most men, whites, conservatives,
Republicans, Southerners and white Protestants. Ralph Nader, who
received 2 percent of the vote, did best among independents,
particularly liberal ones, and among young men. 

But the national election was so close because several large groups
_ voters under 65, independents, voters from the Midwest and the
West and suburbanites _ divided their votes almost evenly between
the two major candidates. 

The accompanying table, drawn from surveys of voters leaving the
polls (including those in Florida), shows how different groups have
voted for president since 1976. 

Because large numbers of people are surveyed, exit polls can help
measure the preferences of groups like Jewish or Asian voters or
young blacks or liberal Republicans whose portion of the voting
population is often too small to examine in typical telephone
surveys. 

The Gender Gap 

Bush received a majority of votes from men and Gore was backed by a
majority of women. That's been a trend for at least 20 years: more
women vote for Democrats; more men prefer Republicans. 

This year, the gap was especially large. Gore got more votes from
women than from men: 12 percentage points more. The gender gap cut
across all age groups and education levels, even among black voters,
who strongly supported Gore overall. 

The gender gap was widest among college graduates and unmarried
voters. 

Party Identification 

Few voters crossed party lines. Large majorities of Republicans
supported Bush. Gore won the votes of most Democrats. Voters who
identified themselves as independent split almost evenly. 

Most independents who described their political ideology as liberal
supported Gore. Bush was backed by independents who characterized
themselves as conservative. Moderate independents were very closely
divided. 

Where They Live 

As in 1996, most Easterners supported the Democrat. But while four
years ago, Southerners were evenly divided between Bill Clinton and
Bob Dole, this year Bush carried the the South. The Midwest and the
West were almost evenly divided between the two candidates. 

Gore did best among urbanites. Bush ran stronger in smaller towns
and in rural areas. Suburban voters split about evenly. 

Pocketbook Concerns 

Voters who say their finances have improved during a president's
tenure usually favor the incumbent, while the challenger is
preferred by those who say their financial situation has
deteriorated. That held true this year. Gore was strongly backed by
voters who said their family's finances were better than four years
ago. Bush won the support of those who said their financial
situation had deteriorated. 

In 1996, one in three voters said their economic situation had
improved over the previous four years. This year, half did. 

Generally, those who say their economic conditions have not changed
divide their support between the two major candidates pretty evenly.
This year, though, two in three voted for Bush. 

Data for 2000 were collected by Voter News Service based on
questionnaires completed by 13,279 voters leaving 300 polling places
around the nation on Election Day. Data for 1996 were based on a
survey conducted by Voter News Service based on questionnaires with
16,627 voters. Data for 1992 were based on a survey conducted by
Voter Research and Surveys with 15,490 voters. Data for 1976 through
1988 were based on surveys conducted by The New York Times and CBS
News: 11,645 in 1988; 9,174 in 1984; 15,201 in 1980 and 15,300 in
1976. 

Family income categories in 1976: Under $8,000, $8,000-$12,000,
$12,001-$20,000, and over $20,000. In 1980: Under $10,000,
$10,000-$24,999, $25,000-$50,000 and over $50,000. In 1984: Under
$12,500, $12,500-$24,999, $25,000-$50,000 and over $50,000. In 1988:
Under $12,500, $12,500-$24,999, $25,000-$50,000, over $50,000 and
over $100,000. In 1992: Under $15,000, $15,000-$29,999,
$30,000-$49,999, $50,000 and over, and $100,000 and over. 

The category of independents includes respondents who indicated they
considered themselves ``something else'' in 1972, 1992, 1996 and
2000. ``Something else'' was not an option the other years. Male and
female college graduates include those with postgraduate education.
In 1984, first-time voter refers to voters first registered to vote
in that year. In 1976 and 1980 the Congressional vote does not
include New York and California. Family financial situation is
compared to one year ago in 1976 and 1980 and four years ago in
1984, 1992, 1996 and 2000; 1976 and 1984 data are from NBC News. 

Those who gave no answer are not shown. Dashes indicate that a
question was not asked or a category was not provided in a
particular year. Asterisks indicate that there was an insufficient
number of respondents.
