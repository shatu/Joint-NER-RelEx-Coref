Jeff Zucker, the longtime executive producer of NBC's ``Today''
program, will be named Friday as the new president of NBC's
entertainment division, replacing Garth Ancier, NBC executives said. 

The move will have a ripple effect on two NBC divisions, forcing the
network to replace Zucker at ``Today,'' where he has led the program
to its most dominant ratings position in decades, and shaking up the
entertainment division, where Zucker has never worked. 

Zucker's enormous success at ``Today,'' where he has served as
executive producer since 1994, has for several years set him up for
a promotion at the network, and he has frequently expressed his
desire to move on from ``Today.'' 

On Tuesday night, Zucker said that after covering the postelection
news on ``Today'' and seeing that story help establish the third
hour of the program, which was only added in October, he had little
left to accomplish at ``Today.'' 

But no job in the news division had either been available or of
interest to Zucker. The move to NBC Entertainment serves as the best
way for NBC to retain an executive they regard as one of the best in
television. 

The decision abruptly ends Ancier's leadership of NBC Entertainment
after only 18 months. His tenure became extremely troubled this fall
after the new lineup of NBC series stumbled badly. But the move's
timing is still somewhat surprising because NBC had enough strength
among its core group of hit shows to win last month's ratings sweep
competition. 

In addition, three series _ ``The West Wing,'' ``Law and Order
S.V.U.'' and ``Third Watch'' _ all added last fall, Ancier's first
at NBC, have since become significant hits for the network. 

But Ancier's ouster had been the subject of widespread rumors in
Hollywood in the last several weeks, largely because of the failure
of this fall's slate of programs. NBC has several aging hits,
including ``Frasier'' and ``Friends,'' that may not have many more
years on the network, and NBC executives have said this fall that it
was especially crucial the network add some new replacements. 

Only one NBC show, ``Ed,'' has performed with any particular
promise, although two others, ``DAG' and ``Cursed,'' have proved at
least serviceable in time periods where they are protected by other
NBC hits. 

But many other new NBC series this fall collapsed quickly, including
two high-profile shows, ``The Michael Richards Show'' and
``Titans.'' Ancier was especially tied to the latter, having argued
strenuously for it last spring before NBC selected its schedule. The
show had been opposed by several other senior NBC executives,
including the network president, Bob Wright, on grounds that it was
tasteless. Ancier had dismissed that criticism. 

Ancier was also the target of some criticism from Wright last year
after CBS, with ``Survivor,'' and ABC, with ``Who Wants To Be A
Millionaire,'' turned their networks around with so-called reality
programs. Wright questioned why NBC Entertainment was the only
network that had not picked up programs in the reality genre. 

Ancier had come to NBC with seemingly ideal qualifications. He had
previously worked at NBC Entertainment, then had run Fox's
programming in the first days of that network and most recently had
managed programming at the WB Network, helping that network
establish itself as a strong competitor for young audiences.
