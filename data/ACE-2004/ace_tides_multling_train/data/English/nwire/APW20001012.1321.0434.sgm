WARREN, Mich. (AP) _ A detective and a drug suspect were fatally
wounded during a struggle while the officer was booking him at
police headquarters. 

Officers said investigators were reviewing a videotape of the lockup
area in an effort to figure out the sequence of events that led to
the shooting Wednesday evening. 

Detective Christopher Wouters had arrested a suspect on drug
charges, Warren police Chief James Vohs said. Both were wounded
around 6:30 p.m. after the man ``produced a gun and there was a
struggle,'' he said. 

Authorities did not immediately say whether the gun belonged to the
detective or the suspect. 

Wouters, 42, died an hour later at St. John Macomb Hospital. The
suspect died later the same night, hospital spokeswoman Rebecca
O'Grady said Thursday. His name wasn't released. 

Vohs described Wouters, a 19-year veteran, as a good officer who was
married and had two young daughters. It was the first time since
1969 that an officer has been killed in the line of duty in Warren,
a large blue-collar Detroit suburb.
