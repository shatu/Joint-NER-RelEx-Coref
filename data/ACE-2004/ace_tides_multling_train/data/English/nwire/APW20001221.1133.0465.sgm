U.S. Economic Growth Slows Sharply 
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. economy slowed sharply to an annual
growth rate of just 2.2 percent in the summer, the weakest
performance in four years, the government said Thursday. The report
provides further evidence that America's boom times are definitely
over. 

The Commerce Department said the third quarter increase in the gross
domestic product _ the economy's total output of goods and services
_ was even weaker than previously believed as the trade deficit
deteriorated further. A month ago, third quarter GDP was estimated
to have risen by 2.4 percent. 

The July-September performance marked a dramatic slowdown from a
sizzling 5.6 percent GDP growth rate in the April-June quarter. 

The sharp falloff in economic growth in the summer and mounting
evidence of more recent weakness, including disappointing Christmas
sales, have increased worries about whether America's record 10-year
economic expansion was in danger of toppling into a recession.
