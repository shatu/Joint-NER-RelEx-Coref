WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Clinton urged Israelis and Palestinians
to undertake an immediate cease-fire after a new outbreak of
bloodshed and called on both sides to condemn all acts of violence. 

``Now is the time to stop the bloodshed, to restore calm, to return
to dialogue and ultimately to the peace process,'' the president
said Thursday afternoon in the White House Rose Garden.
