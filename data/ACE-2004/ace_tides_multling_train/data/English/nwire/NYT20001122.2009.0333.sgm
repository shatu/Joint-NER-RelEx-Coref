While most Americans would be content with a Sony Playstation II or
a sweater twin set under the tree this year, for an increasing
number of people mere cashmere does not say ``I love you'' with
quite the same authority as pashmina. 

The economy may be slowing somewhat, but the top slice of income
earners is still sitting on a huge pile of wealth and is expected to
propel such purveyors of designer delectables as Tiffany &AMP; Co.
and the Neiman Marcus Group into yet another banner financial year. 

Every shopper vaguely suspects that there is as much art as
substance in the difference between an $8 Revlon lipstick and the By
Terry counterpart, going for $49. But luxury-goods companies guard
no secret more ferociously than the cost of making their wares. 

``We are uncomfortable even with the question,'' said Christina Kim,
a spokeswoman for Hermes of Paris. 

Still, it is possible to gain glimpses of enlightenment. 

Public companies have to report gross margins _ the money they take
in after the costs of making their goods are deducted. For a luxury
company like Gucci or Estee Lauder, that number usually runs in
excess of 60 percent of total revenues. That means the actual cost
of making their stuff, from sweaters to thigh-high leather boots, is
less than 40 percent of the average price tag. (By contrast, gross
margins at the Gap and other chain apparel stores rarely rise above
45 percent.) 

And as profitable as cosmetics and accessories can be, most luxury
houses have at least one other blockbuster that is a deep well of
cash. 

For example, one executive at a luxury house explained the rough
cost of producing a high-quality leather handbag. The finest leather
from an Italian (only!) tannery costs $50 to $60. The labor of a
master craftsman to cut and stitch the bag costs roughly $72. The
exclusive metal hardware, like the logo and locks, might account
$45. Add another 5 percent for miscellaneous costs, and all in all
there is $180 worth of bag. 

And that stays the same, this executive says, whether you are paying
$460 for Escada's new handbag in turquoise leather or $4,800 for
that forest green Hermes Kelly handbag that is so frequently out of
stock. 

To be fair, there are very real expenses that will cut the final
profit on luxury products: advertising, fabulous parties to create
buzz, rents on the fanciest boulevards and salaries to the
fine-boned sales clerks who speak in charming foreign accents, to
name a few. But do those outlays for image really change the
intrinsic worth of the product? Suffice it to say that fine minds
differ.
