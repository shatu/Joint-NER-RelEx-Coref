Treatment of Non-Muslims Questioned

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's only Jewish legislator on Sunday
criticized the treatment of non-Muslims in the country, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported. 

``I call on the Muslim religious leaders and the officials of the
judiciary to pay more attention to the rights of non-Muslim families
as far as issues such as blood money and the verdicts of the courts
are concerned,'' said Maurice Motamed, the sole Jewish
representative in Iran's 290-seat parliament. 

Iran's criminal laws award twice as much blood money _ financial
compensation to a murder victim's family _ to Muslims than to
non-Muslims. 

Motamed, speaking during a session at the Majlis, or parliament,
also criticized government recruitment policies. 

Iran maintains that all of its citizens, regardless of their race or
religion, enjoy equal rights. 

Iranian Jews are allowed to practice aspects of their religion but
are forbidden to teach Hebrew. There were 80,000 Jews in Iran just
before the 1979 Islamic revolution, but the community has dwindled
to 25,000. It remains the largest Jewish community in the Middle
East outside Israel. 

Iran came under intense international pressure last year after it
arrested 13 Iranian Jews and later convicted 10 of spying for
Israel.
