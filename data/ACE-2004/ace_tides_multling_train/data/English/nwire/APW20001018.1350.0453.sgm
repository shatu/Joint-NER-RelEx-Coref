Social Security Checks To Jump

WASHINGTON (AP) _ The 45.2 million Americans getting Social Security
checks will see them grow by 3.5 percent next year, the biggest
cost-of-living increase in almost a decade. 

That's because inflation has picked up speed, almost entirely a
reflection of surging energy prices. 

The increases, which will begin showing up in benefit payments for
January, were announced by Social Security based on inflation
figures released Wednesday by the Labor Department. 

The cost-of-living announcement comes just weeks before Americans
elect a new president Nov. 7. Florida and Pennsylvania _ among the
tossup states in the presidential race _ have a large number of
older people, who tend to be the most likely to vote. 

Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, and
Vice President Al Gore, the Democrat, have repeatedly clashed over
Social Security. Bush proposes allowing individuals some control
over how to invest their retirement funds, while Gore says that
would threaten the long-term solvency of the nation's huge
retirement system. 

The 3.5 percent increase was the largest since a 3.7 percent rise in
1992. It means the average monthly check for retirees will rise by
$29 to $845 next year, up from $816 this year. 

That compares with an increase of 2.4 percent for 2000, which
translated into an average of $19 a month more for retirees. 

In addition to retirement checks, the increases affect Social
Security benefits paid to disabled workers and families whose
breadwinners have died. 

The maximum monthly payment for low-income individuals receiving
Supplemental Security Income, known as SSI, also will rise by 3.5
percent. That will boost the maximum monthly SSI check by $18 to
$530. For a couple, the SSI maximum goes up $27 to $796. Increased
payments to SSI recipients will begin on Dec. 29. 

``The annual cost-of-living adjustment is one of the most critically
important features of the Social Security program,'' said Social
Security Commissioner Kenneth Apfel. ``For the elderly, it
guarantees that their foundation of retirement income will remain
strong for as long as they live.'' 

Separately, the Department of Health and Human Services announced
that the monthly Medicare premium deducted from most elderly and
disabled Americans' Social Security checks for insurance coverage of
doctors' office visits will increase by $4.50 to $50 in 2001. The
increase, which takes effect Jan. 1, reflects higher health-care
costs and changes in Medicare law. It is not based on the
cost-of-living adjustment tied to the CPI. 

Since 1975, the benefit cost-of-living adjustment has been
automatic, requiring no vote by Congress. It is calculated based on
changes in the Consumer Price Index _ the government's inflation
yardstick _ from the third quarter of one year to the corresponding
quarter of the next. 

Because of tame inflation, the yearly benefit boosts have been below
3.0 percent since 1994. The 1999 increase of 1.3 percent, matched a
record low set in 1987. 

More recently, consumer prices have been edging up, largely because
of higher energy costs. Crude-oil prices hit a 10-year high in
September, contributing to costlier gasoline and heating oil. 

While overall inflation is rising, it is still moderate compared
with other periods. Double-digit inflation in the late 1970s, for
example, drove the cost-of-living increase up to 14.3 percent in
1980. 

Social Security also announced Wednesday that for working Americans,
the maximum annual earnings subject to Social Security taxes next
year will rise to $80,400 from $76,200. That limit along with the
Social Security tax rate of 6.2 percent is set by law.
