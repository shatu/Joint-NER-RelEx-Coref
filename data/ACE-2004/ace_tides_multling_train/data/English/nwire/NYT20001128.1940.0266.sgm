NEW YORK _ National Geographic and the television production unit of
The New York Times have agreed to collaborate on a weekly science
program that will be shown on National Geographic's coming cable
channel beginning in June. 

The program will take its title from The Time &UR; s' &LR; weekly
Science Times section. The content will be jointly developed by the
channel's news division and the television production unit, New York
Times Television, a subsidiary of The New York Times News Services. 

``The show will be largely based on articles that The New York
Times' science section either has run or plans to run,'' said
Richard Flaste, managing editor of New York Times Television
Enterprises. 

National Geographic Channel is scheduled to be available in 10
million homes this January. National Geographic will own one-third
of the channel and the Fox Cable Networks Group will own the rest.
The companies planning to carry the channel include AT&AMP;T
Broadband, Adelphia Cable and DirecTV. 

National Geographic introduced an international channel in September
1997 that is in 115 countries and reaches 85 million homes. The U.S.
channel will not be an extension of the overseas channel, said
Laureen Ong, president of the American channel. 

The Times is already active in television through a three-year joint
venture with Granada Media to produce documentaries and an
experimental partnership with ABC News to produce reports for
``20/20'' and ``Good Morning America.'' That agreement is scheduled
to expire at the end of this year.
