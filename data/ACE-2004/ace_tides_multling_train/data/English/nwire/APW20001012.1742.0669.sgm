Clinton Lifts Yugoslavia Sanctions

WASHINGTON (AP) _ Celebrating the political rebirth of the people of
Serbia, President Clinton lifted key trade and economic sanctions to
demonstrate support for Belgrade's newly installed government. 

``The victory of freedom in Serbia is one of the most hopeful
developments in Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall,'' the
president said on Friday. ``It ended a dictatorship and it can
liberate an entire region from the nagging fear that ethnic
differences can again be exploited to start wars and shift
borders.'' 

Clinton announced the immediate ending of the oil embargo and flight
ban that were imposed in 1998 to punish and isolate the regime of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. 

``The removal of these sanctions is a first step to ending Serbia's
isolation,'' Clinton said in a written statement. 

James C. O'Brien, the senior U.S. official overseeing developments
in the Balkans, met with new Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica
in Belgrade on Thursday to offer congratulations on Kostunica's
election victory and to highlight the message that further progress
is expected. 

Clinton acted just days after the European Union lifted its own oil
embargo and ban on commercial flights to and from Serbia, the
principal Yugoslav republic. 

``We have a strong interest in supporting Yugoslavia's newly elected
leaders as they work to build a truly democratic society,'' Clinton
said. 

The EU did not remove sanctions that froze overseas assets of
Milosevic and his allies and prohibited them from traveling to 15 EU
nations. 

Clinton said the United States would also ensure that the lifting of
sanctions does not allow Milosevic's supporters ``to continue the
systematic theft of resources that have marked the last 13 years.'' 

``Our disagreement was with the Milosevic regime, not the people of
Serbia who have suffered under the regime's brutal policies,'' the
president said. 

``In that vein we will continue to enforce a ban on travel to the
United States by top members of the Milosevic regime and keep in
place measures that help the new government deter a looting of the
national patrimony during the current period of transition in
Yugoslavia,'' the president said. 

He said the administration also would review restrictions on
Serbia's participation in international financial institutions ``as
Serbia makes its democratic transition and meets its international
obligations.'' 

``There is still much work ahead for the Yugoslav people and their
new government: restoring confidence in the rule of law, rebuilding
an honest economy, accounting for the past while building for a
better future,'' Clinton said. 

``Thankfully, that work can now begin _ without the burden of
isolation and with the friendship of the American people.''
