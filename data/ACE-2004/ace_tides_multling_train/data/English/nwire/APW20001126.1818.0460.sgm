S.Korea Workers Decry Restructuring

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Two major South Korean labor groups
rallied about 15,000 workers in central Seoul on Sunday to protest
government-led corporate restructuring they fear will lead to mass
layoffs. 

It was the first such joint rally in three years for the Federation
of Korean Trade Unions and the militant Korean Confederation of
Trade Unions. The two have a combined membership of 1.8 million. 

The protesters, many carrying signs or wearing red headbands and
vests with slogans such as ``Fight'' and ``Solidarity'' printed on
them, chanted and pumped their fists in the air. 

``If we will be driven out to the streets just for working hard,
let's not work. Let's strike!'' said Kim Yon-hwan, head of an
umbrella group for state utility labor unions. 

The workers marched from Seoul train station to a cathedral a few
miles away, clogging up traffic. They dispersed peacefully after the
2 1/2-hour-long rally. 

Thousands of uniformed police officers, some with shields, stood
around the protesters to guard against possible violence, but there
was no report of clashes. 

The protest was partly in support of workers at Korea Electric Power
Corp., a state-run power company which the government plans to break
into several units and sell. 

A 950-megawatt electric power plant belonging to the firm has
already been sold to a consortium of local and foreign firms. 

Experts say the nation's economy might face recession if the
government does not speed up restructuring heavily indebted
businesses and banks. 

In a drastic measure earlier this month, government-controlled
creditor banks named 52 financially weak companies that should be
shut down or merged for sale. The move shocked tens of thousands of
workers who work for those and other financially shaky companies,
which have been surviving on emergency bank loans. 

South Korea was forced to accept a $58 billion bailout fund from the
International Monetary Fund in late 1997 to save its economy. In
return, it promised to restructure its bloated businesses and
inefficient financial sector.
