SEPANG, Malaysia (AP) _ Michael Schumacher is still celebrating
Ferrari's first Formula One title since 1979. 

``It was a great relief crossing the line at Suzuka,'' Schumacher
said of the Oct. 8 Japanese Grand Prix. ``There has been a couple of
tons of stone falling away. I'm unable to find the exact words to
express in a proper way what it was like.'' 

``The pressure could not have been higher this year. Now that we
have fulfilled our main wish, the pressure will be less.'' 

Schumacher, the German star who won titles in 1994 and 1995 with
Benetton, enters Sunday's season-ending Malaysian Grand Prix with an
insurmountable 12-point lead over two-time defending champion Mika
Hakkinen of McLaren. 

``Now that we have achieved the first target, the next target we
would like is the constructors' championship,'' Schumacher said.
``It is in our hands. We just need a fourth place, which is well
within our means.'' 

Ferrari leads McLaren by 13 points. Hakkinen and McLaren teammate
David Coulthard need to finish at least first and third and shut out
Ferrari grab snatch the constructors' title. 

However, if Schumacher and teammate Rubens Barrichello score at
least three points, or if a McLaren does not win the race, Ferrari
will have the constructor and driving double for the first time
since 1979, when Jody Scheckter paced Ferrari to both victories. 

``It has taken five years at Ferrari to be competitive from the
first race until the last,'' Schumacher said. ``Now that we have it,
it is nice to be there and we have to take advantage of the
situation.'' 

Schumacher has eight victories this year and 43 overall, second only
to Alain Prost (53) on the career list. 

``I'm still young. I'm only 31 years old. I enjoy racing. I enjoy
working with Ferrari,'' Schumacher said. ``I simply want to enjoy
more of this time like we had at Suzuka. And I am sure we will and
why not enjoy it together.'' 

Schumacher has a contract with the Italian team through 2002. 

``It's too early to start speculating about what I will do after
2002,'' Schumacher said. ``I'll start thinking about it at the end
of 2001 or at the beginning of 2002. Not before.'' 

A practice session is set for Friday, and the drivers will qualify
Saturday for Sunday's 56-lap race on 3.44-mile circuit. 

``I would like to win the race,'' Schumacher said. ``I see this as a
race for fun.''
