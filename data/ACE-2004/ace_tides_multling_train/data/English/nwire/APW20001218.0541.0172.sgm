Court Skid Stamps Docket of History

WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Supreme Court's postelection skid into the
once-shunned ``political thicket'' leaves an indelible stamp on the
docket of history and a case that citizens are likely to debate as
long as the republic chooses presidents. 

Unlike many of the court's decisions shaping the country's response
to difficult issues from slavery to abortion, this opinion by a
fractured bench raises a swarm of unanswered questions. 

While Bush v. Gore ended Al Gore's quest for the White House and
effectively made George W. Bush the president-elect, it left
unsettled the question of who won the majority of Florida's
presidential votes. And its implications for the future of the
electoral process can only be guessed at. 

Two hundred years ago, shoehorned into cramped quarters in this
city's new Capitol, intervening in a disputed presidential election
was not a likely option for a court still finding its constitutional
role. 

Presidents sought instead to shape the court to buttress their
often-conflicting views of the course the young republic should
follow. 

By flickering candlelight, in the last hours of his administration,
President John Adams appointed members of his Federalist Party to
federal judgeships, hoping they would control the much-feared
``radical'' notions of Thomas Jefferson and his political allies. 

``Midnight judges,'' the Jeffersonians scoffed. The Federalists
``retreated into the judiciary as a stronghold, the tenure of which
renders it difficult to dislodge them,'' Jefferson wrote soon after
his 1801 inauguration. 

One of those difficult-to-dislodge judges was John Marshall,
nominated by Adams to be chief justice. 

Three years later, in Marbury v. Madison, a case growing out of
Adams' last-minute judicial appointments, Marshall established the
court's power to ``say what the law is.'' 

Marshall declared the supremacy of the Constitution over any law
passed by Congress. He claimed for the Supreme Court the power to
declare a law unconstitutional, establishing the power that is still
its ultimate weapon. 

The court has always moved cautiously. It would take another
half-century before the justices again declared an act of Congress
invalid. 

Moving to refashion the court to suit their own views, Jefferson's
friends in Congress impeached Justice Samuel Chase in 1804, just
months after he and his colleagues had declared that an act of
Congress violated the Constitution. 

The attempt to weaken the court's freedom of action collapsed when
Chase was acquitted after a trial in the Senate. 

Other bids to curb the power of the court or to influence its
decisions by appointments to its bench have been relatively
commonplace. 

Sen. Robert LaFollette, the Wisconsin Progressive, proposed
overriding the court by a two-thirds congressional majority.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt sought to pack the court with new
justices to change its direction. 

Presidential elections, including the one just ended, routinely
include discussions on how a new chief executive's nominations to
fill vacant positions might change the court's philosophical bent. 

Its decisions have rarely been exempt from criticism. But the court
has often evolved with society, tempering its opinions accordingly. 

At times, however, posterity has judged it to have been on the wrong
side of history. 

In the Dred Scott case of 1857, the court under Chief Justice Roger
B. Taney ruled that a slave had no claim to freedom just because he
had lived in U.S. territories where slavery was not permitted. The
court further ruled that slaves could never obtain U.S. citizenship
and that Congress had no power to limit the expansion of slavery, as
it had done in the Missouri Compromise. 

Taney's decision further inflamed North-South divisions. Some credit
it with hastening the outbreak of the Civil War. 

By the mid-20th century, politics represented the one major area
where the court was reluctant to intervene. 

``Courts ought not to enter this political thicket,'' Justice Felix
Frankfurter wrote. In 1946, the nine justices dismissed a case
involving the apportionment of congressional districts. 

That view would slowly change. In 1962, the court abandoned its
caution. Finding remedies to the unequal distribution of political
power was indeed within its constitutional authority. 

Although Supreme Court justices were named to the congressionally
appointed electoral commission that examined the deadlocked 1876
presidential election, it was not until Bush v. Gore that the court
itself weighed the remedies in a disputed presidential election. 

Although the decision will be long debated, the court's word and
authority was final. 

``Let there be no doubt, while I strongly disagree with the court's
decision, I accept it,'' Gore told the nation.
