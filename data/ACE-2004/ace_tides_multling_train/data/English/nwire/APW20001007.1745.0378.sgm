Milosesvic May Undermine Reforms

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Slobodan Milosevic's plans to remain
active in politics could spell trouble for Yugoslavia's newly
elected president and the victorious pro-democracy coalition. 

The disgraced autocrat's Socialist Party and its neo-communist
allies appeared to be on the verge of collapse after massive and
violent protests led them to acknowledge victory by opposition
challenger Vojislav Kostunica in last month's presidential vote. 

Party activities have been suspended since Thursday, when
pro-democracy demonstrators stormed federal parliament, the state
television building and other centers of Milosevic's power. 

Milosevic, who has been indicted by the international war crimes
tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, cannot leave Yugoslavia without
risking arrest and extradition. Kostunica has pledged not to
extradite him. 

But Milosevic appears to retain enough residual power to block
Kostunica's reforms and _ through proxies who still control Serbia's
police _ Yugoslavia's reintegration into the world. 

``I think he is preparing positions for a stab in the back by
consolidating the police (and) creating chaos,'' Zoran Djindjic,
head of the Democratic Party, told The Associated Press. 

After initial speculation that he was hiding out, a visibly shaken
Milosevic appeared on TV late Friday to concede defeat and
congratulate Kostunica on his victory. 

``I intend to rest a little and spend some more time with my family
and especially with my grandson, Marko, and after that to help my
party gain force and contribute to future prosperity,'' he said. 

Other deposed leaders have managed to stay home and stay alive. But
in countries like Chile and Indonesia, the old autocrats have been
troublesome to new democratic regimes, sabotaging their efforts to
overcome the legacy of authoritarian rule. 

Despite massive defeats in the presidential ballot and local council
elections, the Socialists still have a majority in the state
legislature of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic, where they
are allied with the ultranationalist Radical Party. 

The president of Serbia, Milan Milutinovic, is one of Milosevic's
closest cronies. He is also an indicted war criminal, and his fate
depends on Milosevic's own political survival. 

The Serbian presidency has sweeping powers, including direct control
over the state's 100,000-strong police force. Its powers are much
more substantial than those of the federal president, even though
Milosevic beefed up the post's stature under his tenure. 

``Milutinovic occupies a very strong post and he will remain
unswervingly loyal to Milosevic,'' said Braca Grubacic, a Belgrade
political analyst. ``This presents Milosevic with unlimited
possibilities to block any reforms initiated by Kostunica.'' 

Even on the federal level, Milosevic retains significant clout. His
leftist coalition controls 46 of 178 seats in the federal
parliament. Together with an allied party from Montenegro,
Yugoslavia's smaller republic, his allies could conceivably form the
new federal government, sidelining Kostunica. 

Ultimately, however, Milosevic's ability to play any political role
will depend on his ability to rally his badly shaken party. Stunned
by the extent of their electoral defeat, members were reported to be
deserting in droves. 

Some opposition leaders are convinced Milosevic's power will ebb
quickly, now that he has lost control of the government media he
used as his propaganda mouthpiece during 13 years of iron-fisted
rule. 

Milosevic also remains vulnerable to criminal prosecution for
running one of Europe's most corrupt regimes. Some have accused him
of orchestrating a spate of assassinations in which some of the
country's most senior politicians and underworld figures have died. 

``In the end, Milosevic may even prefer extradition to The Hague
rather than stay here and face our justice,'' said opposition leader
Zarko Korac.
