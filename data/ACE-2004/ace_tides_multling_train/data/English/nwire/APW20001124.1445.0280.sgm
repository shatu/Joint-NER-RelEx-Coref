WASHINGTON (AP) _ Republican vice presidential candidate Dick
Cheney, said by his doctor to be recovering well from a mild heart
attack, was being released from the hospital Friday. 

``He's going home,'' said Cheney chief of staff Kathleen Shanahan. 

The 59-year-old Cheney's examining physician said Thursday the
patient was in good condition and that he looked great while resting
up and enjoying Thanksgiving at George Washington University
Hospital.
