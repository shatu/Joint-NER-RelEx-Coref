NEW YORK _ Never mind those points of light a former president
talked about. 

A research company is proposing that ``points of presence'' are what
matter, at least when it comes to online marketing. 

The company, Word of Net, is introducing a system meant to measure
the various points at which computer users are exposed to Web sites,
wherever those exposures may occur. The measurement system, called
the visibility index, is intended to provide information beyond the
tracking of traffic to a site by tracking the exposure to sites
through search engines, keyword inquiries, listings, links from
other sites and category listings in online directories. 

The goal of the index is to help advertisers increase their
visibility online by spending more effectively when buying banners
and other types of interactive advertisements to generate traffic.
That has become particularly important since the dot-com shake-out
began and advertisement dollars have grown increasingly scarce. 

``This is a key marketing competitive-intelligence tool because it
highlights exposure all over the Internet,'' said Astrid van Dorst,
senior analyst for the e-marketing intelligence group at the Gartner
Group in San Jose, Calif., who was briefed about the index by Word
of Net before its public introduction. 

``You will see more of this as Internet metrics reaches the next
level of maturity,'' she added. 

The index data are presented as scores, which are weighted. The
higher the score on the index, the more points of presence for a
site and thus the more visible it is to consumers. 

The Web site ranked first in the initial visibility index, with a
score of 973, is www.aol.com, from America Online. The rest of the
top five are www.zdnet.com, from CNet, with a score of 936;
http://members.aol.com, also from America Online, 925; www.msn.com,
from Microsoft, 922; and www.go.com, from the Walt Disney Co., 915. 

``The real value of our technology is that it provides a way to
measure return on investment for your marketing campaigns,'' said
Eric Sanders, chief executive at Word of Net in Sherman Oaks, Calif. 

``Online advertising is a $5 billion to $7 billion industry, and
it's not nearly accountable enough,'' he added. ``You can use our
data to determine which of your marketing spends generate sales.'' 

The index is also intended to enable advertisers to monitor how
pervasive the mentions of Web sites operated by rivals may be in
cyberspace. 

``This is helpful because it gives you a sense of how you come up
against your competitors,'' said Michele Chaboudy, vice president
for marketing at MarketWatch.com in San Francisco, which operates a
Web site in the crowded field of financial news. 

``And it can help you plan your marketing campaigns,'' she added,
``because you can actually see where people are coming to your site
from.'' 

Chaboudy described herself as ``pretty skeptical'' about new
measurements ``because I've seen a lot of them.'' But data that Word
of Net has shared with her so far led to a decision ``to look at
some places we might want to advertise,'' where MarketWatch.com is
not advertising now, she added. 

As a result, MarketWatch.com is planning to become a Word of Net
subscriber, Chaboudy said, adding with a laugh, ``Of course, we
always negotiate the price.'' 

Speaking of money, Sanders said that Word of Net had ``raised $2
million to date'' from investors, adding that additional money was
being sought. Among the clients of Word of Net, he listed DirecTV,
Forbes, Park Place Entertainment, Tickets.com, Sony, Universal and
Variety.
