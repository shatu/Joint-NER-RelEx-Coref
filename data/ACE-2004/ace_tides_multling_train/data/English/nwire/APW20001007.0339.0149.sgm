Foreign Policy Hits Bush, Gore Race 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WASHINGTON (AP) _ Republicans give George W. Bush credit for
promoting a Russian role in smoothing the transition from despot to
democrat in Yugoslavia _ an idea dismissed in debate as risky by Al
Gore even as his boss was trying to get Moscow to step in. 

It's the first foreign policy spat of an otherwise domestically
focused presidential campaign between two candidates who have
sharply different views of America's role in the world and a wide
gap in foreign policy experience. 

``Russians must use their leverage on Mr. Milosevic to make sure he
... finally leaves,'' Bush said Friday in Cedar Rapids, Iowa,
repeating what he said in Tuesday's first presidential debate. 

As he spoke, Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov was in Yugoslavia,
meeting with ousted leader Slobodan Milosevic and recognizing
opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica as winner of the Sept. 24
election. 

In the debate, Gore jumped on Bush, dismissing his idea of bringing
in the Russians as unwise because they hadn't recognized Kostunica
as victor. 

``I'm not sure that it's right for us to invite the president of
Russia to mediate this dispute there, because we might not like the
result that comes out of that,'' Gore said. 

On Friday, Bush criticized his opponent's statement. 

``Either he didn't know what the president was doing or he did know
what the president was doing and wasn't willing to share that with
the American people,'' Bush said in Florida, where he was
campaigning. 

Gore campaign aides insisted he was aware of administration efforts
to persuade the Russians to convince Milosevic to go. 

In Thursday night's vice presidential debate, as Kostunica
supporters stormed Belgrade to drive out Milosevic, Republican Dick
Cheney said Gore had been ``pooh-poohing'' the idea of Russian
involvement while the administration was doing just about what Bush
had proposed. 

Cheney said Bush deserved ``a lot of credit for that.'' 

Marc Thiessen, spokesman for the GOP-controlled Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said administration officials told members of
Congress in a briefing Wednesday that Clinton sent a letter to
Russian President Vladimir Putin three weeks ago ``asking him to
step in and do exactly what Bush suggested'' and on Saturday
personally urged Putin by phone to intervene. 

``It was Bush who was completely informed, whose instincts were
right, and it was Gore who was uninformed and didn't even know the
administration policy,'' Thiessen said. 

Gore on Friday welcomed Yugoslavia's change, saying it brings the
country ``back into the community of nations.'' He added, ``This is
a day for celebration,'' without commenting on the Russian issue. 

The White House, however, came to his defense. 

``What the vice president said is something the president fully
agrees with, which is that the United States did not support any
role in which Russia would mediate between Milosevic and
Kostunica,'' said presidential spokesman Jake Siewert, who confirmed
that Clinton spoke with Putin about Yugoslavia last weekend. 

The dispute over a foreign policy matter comes late in a campaign
that has given little attention to most offshore issues. 

What discussion there has been has tended to involve a contrast in
plans for the military. Bush decries the state of the military and
calls for more-limited engagement abroad. Gore defends current
military readiness and urges a definition of national security
interests that would include environmental, health and other global
issues. 

The candidates also have differences on missile defense, nuclear
arms cuts, global warming, immigration and trade, but none of those
issues has turned into a major debate. 

Gore has been active in foreign affairs as vice president, serving
on commissions with key countries, including one with former Russian
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. 

Bush's supporters say that despite his lack of direct foreign policy
experience, his record as Texas governor, including dealings with
neighbor Mexico, show he'll inspire the trust of allies and the
respect of adversaries. 

Cheney, defense secretary for four years under President Bush, has
lent a measure of experience to candidate Bush's claims that the
Clinton administration has shortchanged the military and GOP plans
to limit foreign deployments. 

Democrat Joseph Lieberman matches some of Cheney's foreign policy
experience with his Senate Armed Services Committee membership and
involvement on a range of international issues during his dozen
years in the Senate.
