Astronauts Install Power Equipment

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ Two spacewalking astronauts clamped
power equipment onto the international space station on Tuesday and
inadvertently added to the collection of junk whizzing around Earth. 

A cap for a depressurization valve floated away moments after Bill
McArthur emerged from space shuttle Discovery. 

The aluminum cover, about the size of a gas cap on a car, bounced
against the space station, then against the shuttle robot arm. Then
it was gone. 

``It was a nice billiard shot,'' McArthur radioed. ``It's become the
latest addition to tiny bodies orbiting the Earth.'' 

Mission Control said the lost cap was no reason for concern. Its
tether either came loose or broke. 

The main purpose of Tuesday's spacewalk _ the third in as many days
_ was to mount two power converters on the space station's new
aluminum framework, or truss. 

Astronaut Leroy Chiao performed the job from the end of Discovery's
robot arm. He removed the 175-pound converters one by one from the
shuttle cargo bay. From inside the shuttle, Michael Lopez-Alegria
used the robot arm to give Chiao a lift. 

The converters will be used to regulate power once a pair of solar
wings _ stretching 240 feet from tip to tip _ are installed during
the next construction mission, in December. 

Chiao and McArthur clearly enjoyed their 240-mile-high construction
work. 

``How would you like to live on this thing for a few months?''
McArthur asked. 

``I think that would be pretty cool,'' Chiao replied. 

By the time the seven-hour spacewalk ended, the two had completed
all their cable connections, toolbox work and other chores. 

One spacewalk remains. On Wednesday, Lopez-Alegria and Jeff Wisoff
will go back out to clean the top of the truss for the arrival of
the solar wings, test their mini jetpacks and practice carrying each
other. NASA wants to see how hard it would be for a spacewalker to
rescue an incapacitated colleague. 

When Discovery pulls away Friday, it will leave behind 10 tons of
new space station pieces. 

The station's first permanent crew is supposed to arrive in early
November.
