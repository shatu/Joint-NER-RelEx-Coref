TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ The Florida Supreme Court rejected an appeal
Friday by Vice President Al Gore that it begin the immediate manual
recount of 14,000 disputed ballots from South Florida, forcing
Gore's contest of the presidential election into a lower-court trial
that begins Saturday morning. 

An hour later, the state's highest court dealt another blow to
supporters of Gore in Palm Beach County, refusing to order a new
election that many voters said was necessary because of the
confusing nature of the ``butterfly'' ballot. 

The day in Tallahassee was not a complete loss for the vice
president's camp, however. Judge N. Sanders Sauls of Leon County
Circuit Court, who is presiding over the contest lawsuit, announced
what could be a relatively brisk pace for Saturday's trial,
expressing the hope that it could be concluded in one marathon
12-hour session. 

If the judge should agree on Saturday to Gore's demand that the
ballots be counted, the Democratic team would not be much further
behind schedule than if the Supreme Court had agreed to the appeal. 

Lawyers for Gov. George W. Bush have vowed to use every argument at
their disposal to make certain that no ballots are counted, and that
the contest lawsuit is dismissed. But they backed away Friday from
some earlier plans that could have delayed the trial, including a
demand that three Florida counties send 1.17 million ballots to
Tallahassee, in addition to the 1.16 million ballots from Palm Beach
and Miami-Dade counties that finished arriving here Friday. 

Instead, the Bush lawyers agreed to the proposal by Sauls that the
ballots in Volusia, Broward and Pinellas counties simply be
impounded as possible evidence where they are, and not be
transported. 

Bush's lawyers also said they would not insist that the opening of
the trial deal with a series of new issues they raised in a brief on
Thursday night. 

Those issues include whether Gore is really a candidate entitled to
bring a contest lawsuit _ technically, only the electors for a
candidate are on a presidential ballot _ and whether any
presidential election can truly be contested under Florida law. 

The Bush team also agreed to call no more than 20 witnesses at the
trial, not the 93 named in a witness list submitted Thursday night.
Gore's lawyers plan to call two witnesses. 

The willingness of the Bush team to pare down its demands may have
come from the realization that Sauls was not going to allow any
obvious delay tactics in the trial. The judge said he understood why
Gore needed to accelerate the process; if the trial, the
vote-counting and any subsequent appeals extend beyond Dec. 12, the
Florida Legislature will send Bush's electors to the Electoral
College and the contest lawsuit will likely become moot. 

At a preliminary hearing Friday afternoon, Sauls made it clear he
would take a no-nonsense approach to the trial. 

Lawyers for the various parties to the suit would not be allowed to
repeat arguments already made, he said, an important consideration
because there are multiple defendants in the suit: Bush; Katherine
Harris, the Florida secretary of state; and the election boards of
three counties.
