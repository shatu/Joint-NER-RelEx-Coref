WASHINGTON _ When the leader of the Hezbollah in Syrian-occupied
Lebanon came up with a plan to kidnap three Israeli soldiers six
weeks ago, his Iranian sponsors cautioned him to first get the
approval of Bashar Assad, the new president of Syria. 

That's because Israel was expected to retaliate against Hezbollah
forces in areas controlled by Syrian troops. Ever since Israel's
troops pulled out of its Lebanese buffer zone, Hezbollah's terrorism
has been closely coordinated with Bashar in Damascus. 

Usually reliable intelligence sources note that the inexperienced
Bashar, eager to establish credentials in the Arab world as a
militant enemy of Israel, gave his approval to the kidnap plan. This
despite the danger that the Hezbollah's capture of Israeli soldiers
could lead to armed confrontation in Lebanon between Syrian and
Israeli forces. 

On or about Oct. 8, Hassan Nasrallah, secretary general of
Hezbollah, reported directly to Bashar that the kidnapping had been
carried out as planned. Bashar was heard to have congratulated him
on its ``smooth execution,'' goes the undercover account, and
assured the terrorist leader full backing against anticipated mild
U.N. reaction as well as a stronger response from Israel. 

The risk accepted by Arab and Persian leaders in a daring
provocation within what Israel considers its territory was evidence
of what is emerging as Yasser Arafat's strategy. 

From his turnabout that so surprised President Clinton at the Camp
David fiasco, to his reluctance to speak out to restrain the rioting
of Palestinians and sniping of his gunmen-police, his plan can be
deduced: 

First step is to transform the ``peace process,'' which was in
danger of succeeding in establishing a small Palestinian state, into
a religious ``war process'' for control of Jerusalem and a state
incorporating Jordan and Israel. What keeps Arafat in power is not
the dubious economic promise of a struggling dictatorship but his
militant followers' dream of driving the Jews out of the Middle
East. 

Second step is to whip up support in world opinion by creating
innocent victims of Israeli guns. Palestinian snipers draw fire into
civilian crowds for the sole purpose of sacrificing innocents,
creating anguished funeral demonstrations and spreading hatred.
Every casualty is exploitable; every picture of a boy with a
slingshot rather than a gun is a small victory; the gut-wrenching
film of the boy dying in a crossfire was a propaganda triumph. 

Though such a war process does not win military victory, it delivers
results: In a much less well-armed form of intifada a few years ago,
it led to Oslo and ultimately to Ehud Barak's stunning concessions.
But to attain a goal of stimulating the defeat of Israel by Arab
armies far stronger than his own, Arafat needs more than sustained
low-level belligerency that wears down the Israeli will; he needs to
provoke a new Middle East war. 

That explains the campaign to sacrifice Palestinian women and
children, opening the possibility for a stray Israeli shell to
inflict horrific tragedy. Infuriated Muslims throughout the region
then put pressure on shaky sheiks to support another such war. 

That's why we see Arafat's allies in the Hezbollah enticing Syria's
strongman into taking risks his dictator-father Hafez _ having
learned a bloody lesson that cost him the Golan _ would have
avoided. Arafat also knows that Iraq's Saddam Hussein, developing
weaponry to counter Israel's nuclear deterrent, is spoiling to send
his tanks and Scuds through Jordan into his enemy's homeland. 

The possibility of such a Palestinian-sparked conflagration must be
foremost in Barak's mind as he deals with the rioting and
kidnapping. He must respond with seeming toughness, lest Israelis
scorn him for being weak; yet he must not use too much firepower,
lest he fall into Arafat's wider-war trap. 

Barak's demonstrated dovishness may force him to err on the side of
using ever-greater force and thereby be drawn into Arafat's war
process. The paradox is that the Israeli opposition leader Arik
Sharon's longtime reputation for fierceness would enable the Likud
leader to enforce separation, control military escalation and stop
that war process. 

America's mind is fixed on its own affairs, but thanks to Arafat,
whoever wins the White House is sure to have a stressful first 100
days.
