XFL Has First Draft

CHICAGO (AP) _ ``Stone Cold'' Steve Austin, The Rock and Triple H
weren't among the selections. 

But pro wrestling did manage to leave a mark on the first XFL draft
Saturday. After all, Austin's mass-produced signature was right
there on a league credential. 

The new league, a joint venture of the World Wrestling Federation
and NBC, features some former NFL first-rounders while promising a
no holds-barred approach and off-the-mat rules when it begins in
February. 

A black football trimmed in red and white, no fair catches on punts,
no quarterback-in-the-grasp rule, miked huddles and cameras
everywhere _ on the sideline, in locker rooms and in the helmets of
selected players. 

``We're going for something that millions of kids played in the
school yard, something that resonates with people who've enjoyed the
game on all different levels,'' league president Basil DeVito said
after helping conduct Saturday's first 10 rounds of the draft before
about 100 fans at a hotel near O'Hare International Airport. 

``It's simple,'' DeVito said of his league's premise. ``Nobody owns
it. Nobody owns football.'' 

According to the league's Web site, a quarterback's base salary for
the 10-game schedule will be about $50,000, but players will be able
to collect $2,500 bonuses for each win. It's incentive pay and
that's fine with at least one of the league's coaches. 

``We have no negotiations, you have no owners in there. You have no
owners in there in who are going to disrupt the progress of the
league because it's centrally controlled,'' said Chicago Enforcers
coach Ron Meyer, former head coach of the Patriots and Colts, who
took the job when Chicago favorite Dick Butkus resigned to take a
job in the league office. 

``I've been in a couple of start-up situations and I know the
pitfalls,'' Meyer said. 

``It is a work in progress, certainly. But we're light years ahead
of what I envisioned.'' 

DeVito said the league had sold 120,000 season tickets so far and
hopes to average 25,000 fans a game. 

``Is it going to be perfect? No. Nothing is,'' LA Xtreme coach Al
Luginbill said. ``But we're going to shock some people.'' 

Before the draft started, the eight teams were allowed to protect
picks from three colleges each. Among those designated were former
NFL first-rounders Mike Croel, Alvin Harper, Tommy Maddox and Marcus
Nash. 

Once the draft began, five quarterbacks were the first players
chosen. Ex-Maryland quarterback Scott Milanovich had the distinction
of being the first XFL player selected _ by the Xtreme. 

The Enforcers, with the last pick of the first round, nabbed running
back John Avery, a first-round pick of the Miami Dolphins in 1998. 

And near the end the first day _ the draft continues Sunday and
Monday _ quarterback Jim Druckenmiller, a first-round choice of the
San Francisco 49ers in 1997, was selected by the Maniax with the
78th selection. 

Avery, Druckenmiller, running back Vaughn Dunbar and linebacker
Craig Powell, who both went to the San Francisco Demons, were all
NFL first-round selections. 

``Interestingly, all the coaches tell me they got exactly the
players they wanted,'' DeVito said. ``And since they are still
undefeated, I guess that's OK.''
