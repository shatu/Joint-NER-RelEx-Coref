Canadian authorities arrested two Vancouver-area men on Friday and
charged them in the deaths of 329 passengers and crew members of an
Air-India Boeing 747 that blew up over the Irish Sea in 1985, en
route from Canada to London. 

The two, Ripudan Singh Malik, 53, and Ajaib Singh Bagri, 51, were
arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, capping what the
Mounties called the longest and most expensive criminal
investigation in the nation's history. The downing of the jet is
considered the deadliest act of sabotage in the history of aviation. 

In an eight-count indictment, the men were charged with using
suitcases packed with explosives to bomb two Air-India jets on the
same day, June 23, 1985. Air-India Flight 182 blew up in midair,
killing all aboard. 

An hour earlier, a suitcase blew up in Narita Airport, outside
Tokyo, as it was being loaded onto Air-India Flight 301, destined
for Bangkok; it killed two baggage handlers. 

Animosity against Air-India dated back to 1984, when Indian troops
occupied and destroyed Sikhdom's holy site, the Golden Temple in
Amritsar. The temple had become a center for radicals seeking an
independent Sikh state, an issue that polarized the Sikh diaspora
around the world. Malik and Bagri, who are both Sikhs, are to appear
in court on Monday. 

Malik, who runs a school and credit union catering to the immigrant
community, has long been a suspect in the case. 

Bagri, a mill worker from Kamloops, British Columbia, was described
Thursday in The Province in Vancouver as a key lieutenant of
Talwinder Singh Parmar, a Sikh militant leader shot to death by the
Indian police in 1992. 

Bagri was also charged with trying to murder Tara Singh Hayer,
editor of The Indo-Canadian Times, North America's largest Punjabi
newspaper, in 1998. Hayer survived the attempt but three weeks later
was shot to death in his wheelchair in his garage. 

``Although arrests have been made, this does not mark the conclusion
of the police investigation,'' Constable Cate Galliford, spokeswoman
for the Mounties' Air-India task force, said at news conference on
Friday afternoon. She said, ``We do anticipate future arrests, but
we don't know when those will take place.'' 

Beverly Busson, the Mounties' commanding officer in Vancouver, told
the news conference, ``This has been a worldwide investigation with
extremely challenging logistical problems.'' 

Canada is home to half a million people of Indian origin, most of
them Sikhs. Four Sikhs serve in Parliament, mostly from the
Vancouver area, where half of the nation's Indo-Canadians live. 

Earlier this year, a Sikh, Ujjal Dosanjh, became premier of British
Columbia and Canada's first nonwhite provincial premier. Dosanjh, a
moderate, paid a price for speaking out against Sikh extremism that
gripped the Vancouver community after the Golden Temple raid. 

Four months before the AirIndia bombing, Dosanjh was attacked
outside his law office by a man wielding an iron rod. Dosanjh
suffered a broken hand and needed 80 stitches for head wounds. 

In recent years radicalism has ebbed. Moderates have won control of
Vancouver's largest Sikh temples, the provincial government has cut
''community development'' grants that once went to radical temples
and the federal government is trying to curb Punjabi hate-radio
transmissions broadcast from Washington State. 

As rumors of arrests circulated in Vancouver, Premier Dosanjh said
charges would be a large step for Canadian justice. He said, ``I
think people of British Columbia, people of Canada, would finally
heave a sigh of relief.''
