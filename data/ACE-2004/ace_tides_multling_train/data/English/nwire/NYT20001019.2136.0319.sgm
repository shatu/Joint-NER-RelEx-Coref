ALL JOKING ASIDE, BUSH FACES LETTERMAN

It started like a normal night on the ``Late Show with David
Letterman.'' Expecting Gov. George W. Bush as his guest, Letterman
quizzed an audience member about Texas. He showed footage of the
governor emerging from a black car. He brought up Bush's open mike
faux pas about a reporter. 

But quickly after that Letterman had a surprise for anyone who was
expecting a normal night of comedy _ and from the look of it, Bush
was also surprised. The host grilled the Republican presidential
candidate on the death penalty, the bombing of a Navy ship in Yemen,
violence in the Middle East and pollution in Texas. He hardly seemed
to be joking, even though he punctured his questions with his
trademark laugh. 

Bush did get in some good lines. Asked whether he thought he had
done well in the debate, he said, ``well a lot of folks don't think
I can string a sentence together so when I was able to do so, the
expectations were so low that all I had to do was say, `Hi, I'm
George W. Bush.'' 

But soon Letterman was bearing in on the death penalty, saying ``we
make a lot of jokes about you electrocuting people in Texas'' and
asking whether there was some circumstance that would change Bush's
position on capital punishment. 

``Well obviously if the system were unfair, I'd think about it''
Bush said. ``You know it's a serious business. I hope that you're
not laughing at the expense of victims or other people who are put
to death of course.'' 

Letterman pressed, ``Nothing you can imagine would cause a change of
heart here?'' Bush said he might change his mind if he did not think
that executions saved lives. ``Or perhaps if someone were wrongly
executed?'' Letterman said. ``Well, definitely on that of course,''
allowed the governor. 

Soon the two were debating Bush's plan for oil drilling in a nature
preserve in Alaska and smog in Texas. 

``Don't you have bad air pollution down in Texas,'' the host
wondered. Bush said ``it's getting better'' and noted ``we have a
lot of cars.'' 

A taping of a ``Saturday Night Live'' to be shown the weekend before
Election Day went more as planned. But there had to be several
retakes because Bush, usually a chronic word mangler, could not
produce the effect on command. Told to mispronounce the word
``ambivalent'' for comic effect, he kept pronouncing it correctly.
