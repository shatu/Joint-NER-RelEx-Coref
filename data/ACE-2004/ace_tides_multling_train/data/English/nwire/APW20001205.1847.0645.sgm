Court Blocks Pinochet House Arrest

SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ A court of appeals on Tuesday suspended Gen.
Augusto Pinochet's house arrest while it studied a judge's
explanation for indicting the former dictator on homicide and
kidnapping charges. 

Meanwhile, angry supporters of Pinochet intensified their campaign
to have Judge Juan Guzman, who issued the indictment Friday, removed
from the case. 

The court of appeals panel voted 3-0 to suspend Guzman's arrest
order until it decides whether to uphold or repeal his indictment of
the 85-year-old general. 

Guzman submitted his explanation Tuesday, but its contents were
unknown. The court is to reconvene Wednesday or Thursday to hear
arguments from lawyers on both sides. 

The court panel also blocked actions related to the indictment,
including a prohibition on Pinochet traveling abroad. Pinochet,
meanwhile, remained at his country house southwest of Santiago. 

Minor scuffles broke among Pinochet's supporters and opponents
outside the court building during the 90-minute session. Police
separated them. 

Guzman indicted Pinochet, holding him responsible for the actions by
the ``Caravan of Death,'' a military party that killed 73 political
prisoners shortly after the 1973 coup in which Pinochet ousted
Marxist President Salvador Allende. 

Pinochet was charged with homicide for 55 victims whose bodies were
recovered and kidnapping for 18 who remain unaccounted for. 

Right-wing members of congress, defense lawyers, retired army
generals and other backers of Pinochet want Guzman ousted from the
case, claiming he has acted in an arbitrary and irregular manner
that violates Pinochet's rights. 

Ambrosio Rodriguez, a key member of Pinochet's legal team, said
complaints against Guzman will be brought to the Supreme Court. 

Guzman's actions are ``denigrating for the courts,'' an association
of retired army generals said. And right-wing Congressmen Ivan
Moreira and Cristian Leay said Guzman should ``immediately be
removed'' from the case. 

The increased criticism of Guzman came as the court reviewed his
reasons for indicting Pinochet. The day before, amid indications of
discontent in the military over the indictment, the court had given
the judge a 24-hour deadline to do so. 

The main complaint against Guzman is that he indicted Pinochet
before questioning him, as is mandated by law. The judge's
indictment said Pinochet answered two written questionnaires sent to
him while he was under house arrest in London until last March. 

Guzman said those written questionnaires must be considered the
mandatory interrogation. Pinochet's defense rejects that argument. 

The defense also protested that Guzman indicted Pinochet without
first permitting the mental and neurological tests he had ordered
Pinochet to undergo to determine his fitness to stand trial. 

The judge insisted Tuesday that he has acted according to the law. 

``I am at the disposition of our courts. I think I have made a very
good investigation,'' he told Associated Press Television News. 

The Supreme Court _ which has the authority to remove Guzman from
the case _ has also asked Guzman to explain why he sent a letter of
support to Clara Szczaranski, a state prosecutor who was a plaintiff
against Pinochet when he was stripped of his congressional immunity.
Szczaranski has been criticized by Pinochet supporters in Congress. 

The appeals hearings may take two or three days. The case is
expected to reach the Supreme Court, since both sides have said they
will appeal a negative ruling. 

Rodriguez, Pinochet's lawyer, said Tuesday's decision ``allows us to
calmly prepare to state our case in court tomorrow.'' He indicated
that the defense will center its arguments on the alleged
``irregular and arbitrary'' actions by Guzman. 

Anti-Pinochet attorney Alfonso Insunza, however, said the ruling
``in no way anticipates'' what may happen with the indictment.
