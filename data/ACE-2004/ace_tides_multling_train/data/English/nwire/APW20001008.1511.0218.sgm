Kostunica Forming New Government

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With Vojislav Kostunica in office as
president, backers of the pro-democracy leader embarked Sunday on
the potentially volatile task of forming a government that tries to
exclude backers of former leader Slobodan Milosevic. 

Kostunica's team was faced with a difficult task: Putting together a
government with as few old faces as possible, while placating a
Milosevic wing that still wields considerable power. 

``We need a government of discontinuity,'' said opposition leader
Zoran Djindjic, who helped manage Kostunica's rise to power _ from
his election campaign through the brief revolt that forced Milosevic
to concede defeat and Kostunica's swearing-in Saturday. 

Milosevic himself has said he will remain in Yugoslavia as a
political force. Kostunica has said he will defy Western demands to
surrender the outgoing president and others indicted by the U.N. war
crimes tribunal in The Hague. 

And Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic, still is run by a government
of Milosevic cronies including Serbian President Milan Milutinovic _
like Milosevic, indicted by the tribunal. Milutinovic controls
approximately 100,000 policemen in his republic and, indirectly,
much of the republic's economy. 

Kostunica's pro-democracy forces have said they would demand early
elections for new Serbian parliament and president. 

Kostunica scored a stunning upset over Milosevic in the Sept. 24
presidential election. Milosevic's attempt to deny Kostunica's
victory sparked a national uprising, and he conceded defeat Friday. 

Norway's Foreign Minister Thorbjoern Jagland and Mladjan Dinkic, the
head of an influential group of economists, demanded Sunday that
Milosevic be punished for vote-rigging. 

``We now expect state prosecutors to bring charges against Slobodan
Milosevic,'' Dinkic said. A human rights group in Yugoslavia, the
Humanitarian Law Fund, also demanded punishment for the ousted
autocrat, issuing long lists of his alleged misdeeds. 

Dinkic also called for a donor's conference on Yugoslavia with the
aim of injecting at least $500 million into the cash-strapped
country over the next year. 

Cleaning house at top levels is also seen as important for
Yugoslavia in its efforts to break out of a decade of sanctions and
international isolation meant to bring Milosevic to heel. 

Milosevic is blamed by the West for starting _ and then losing _
four Balkan wars that broke out in the last decade when parts of
Yugoslavia began to seek independence. Those conflicts were marked
by horrific acts of violence against civilians, which prompted
Western governments to impose sanctions and isolate the government
in Belgrade. 

A new government should ``be able to show up in Brussels and
Washington and say: `the country has democratized ... we ask from
you to lift the sanctions,''' Djindjic said. 

Both the United States and the European Union have said they will
begin to lift sanctions once the new government is in place. French
Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine confirmed Sunday that the EU would
partially lift sanctions on Monday. 

Djindjic spoke after the inaugural session of the Yugoslav
Parliament, where Kostunica took office. Kostunica pledged to follow
his conscience in leading Yugoslavia and urged lawmakers to bury
past enmities that led to bloodshed and chaos. 

The 56-year-old legal scholar promised to return Yugoslavia to
democracy and end the ethnic conflict and economic devastation that
marked the 13 years of Milosevic's rule. 

``Everything is peaceful,'' he said. ``Yugoslavia and Serbia have
joined the family of democratic nations.'' 

Still, discord could resurface, at least in parliament. 

The swearing-in itself was repeatedly delayed by Milosevic allies
who contested parts of the Sept. 24 vote. 

And with Kostunica's 18-party opposition block short of an absolute
majority, it appears compelled to deal with the Socialist People's
Party of Montenegro, the smaller Yugoslav republic. 

That party backed Milosevic until his downfall and now seeks to have
one of its own appointed as Yugoslavia's prime minister _ the
constitution says that if the president is from Serbia, the prime
minister must be Montenegrin. 

With the opposition outnumbered in parliament, a nonpartisan
government of experts, as favored by many in the Kostunica camp, has
little chance of being formed.
