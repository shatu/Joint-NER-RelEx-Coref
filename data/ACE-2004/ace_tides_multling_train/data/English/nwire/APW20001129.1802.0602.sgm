Sale of Copley Newspaper Delayed 
</HEADLINE>

CHICAGO (AP) _ A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining
order against Copley Press Inc. blocking the sale of The News Sun in
Waukegan to Hollinger International. 

The judge's ruling was prompted by a lawsuit filed last week by the
union representing editorial workers at the paper, which claims the
sale would not require Hollinger to honor a collective-bargaining
agreement reached between the paper and employees. 

Lawyers for the Chicago Newspaper Guild say language in the
agreement is ``not satisfactory.'' 

U.S. District Judge Blanche Manning on Tuesday barred the sale of
the paper for at least 10 days, giving Copley time to reword the
agreement. 

``If the sale were allowed to proceed, the union would be without a
legal remedy and would suffer the irreparable harm of having the
(agreement) being rendered a nullity,'' Manning wrote. 

After the hearing, lawyers for Copley would not say if they would
appeal Manning's restraining order. 

Calls to Douglas A. Darch, an attorney for Copley, were not
immediately returned on Wednesday. 

The guild has filed a grievance to have the matter arbitrated with
Copley before the sale is completed. 

Hollinger International, owner of the Chicago Sun-Times and the
Daily Southtown in Tinley Park, is attempting to acquire The News
Sun and other northern Illinois Copley newspapers, including The
Courier News in Elgin, The Beacon News in Aurora and The Herald News
in Joliet. 

Although the ruling did not mention the other Copley Press papers,
it is expected that The News Sun issue will have be resolved before
the sale of the entire group is finalized.
