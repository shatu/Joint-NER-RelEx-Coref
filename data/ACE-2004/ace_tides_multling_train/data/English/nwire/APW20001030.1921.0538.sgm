U.S. Embassy in Jakarta Still Closed

JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The U.S. ambassador sharply criticizes
Indonesia's reform efforts. Indonesian leaders criticize him right
back, calling him an interfering bully. Angry Indonesians search
hotels for Americans. The U.S. Embassy closes its doors to the
public. 

Relations between the United States and this sprawling southeast
Asian nation have soured in recent months, poisoned in part by
bitter exchanges between the U.S. ambassador and local officials.
The problem has been compounded by anger in Indonesia, the world's
most populous Muslim country, over Washington's stance on the
Israeli-Palestinian violence _ many here say the United States has
taken Israel's side. 

Add the factors together, and U.S. officials don't like what they
see: They have advised U.S. citizens in Indonesia to be wary. 

On Monday, the U.S. Embassy condemned what it described as ``hostile
actions'' that threaten American lives and endanger relations along
with trade, investment and tourism: 

_Over the weekend, Islamic militants went to hotels in the central
Javanese city of Solo, demanding that American tourists leave the
country within 48 hours. 

_The embassy, located across Jakarta's main park from the
presidential palace, suspended its public functions for at least a
week after a series of protests and threats. Muslim youths recently
staged a half dozen rallies in front of the embassy to protest
Washington's perceived bias in favor of Israel. 

_The U.S. consulate in Indonesia's second-largest city, Surabaya,
also has been attacked, and American and Israeli flags are regularly
burned in the streets. 

_A U.S. tourist was detained and accused of spying after
photographing a riot in the province of Irian Jaya. 

Just a year ago, Washington was offering enthusiastic backing for
Indonesia's nascent democracy. But in the months since, reform has
stalled amid rampant violence, political infighting and scandal.
Sectarian fighting regularly claims lives in several Indonesian
regions and pro-Indonesian militias continue to attack peacekeepers
in East Timor, the territory that gained independence from Indonesia
last year. 

Such problems have led to growing discord between Indonesian
officials and U.S. Ambassador Robert Gelbard. 

Gelbard arrived in Jakarta last year after earning a reputation as a
tough talker as President Clinton's envoy to the Balkans. Among
other things, he has publicly insisted that Indonesia's government
make good on promises to take difficult steps to fix the economy and
bring to justice those responsible for the bloody destruction of
East Timor after the independence vote. 

Indonesian lawmakers have been irritated by Gelbard's blunt style:
They prefer to conduct politics in a polite and non-confrontational
way that follows the traditions of the main island of Java. Last
week some members of a parliamentary committee urged the government
to declare Gelbard ``persona non grata.'' The call was rejected by
President Abdurrahman Wahid. 

``We don't hate America as a nation, but we regret the ambassador,''
commission chairman Ananta Baharuddin said at a committee hearing. 

Legislators accuse Gelbard and Washington of bullying the
government. Military leaders accuse them of interfering in
Indonesia's internal affairs. 

In September, three of the U.N. workers stationed in East Timor were
killed in Indonesian-controlled West Timor. The United States is
seen as the driving force behind international pressure on Indonesia
in the wake of those deaths, said Dewi Fortuna Anwar, an adviser to
Wahid's predecessor, B.J. Habibie. 

``People find it very unfair that the United States harshly
criticizes Indonesia over the deaths of three U.N. workers and then
does not condemn Israel over the deaths of more than 100
Palestinians,'' she said. 

``Countries going through transition are always more nationalistic
and sensitive to outside influences. But this is also a matter of
personality,'' Anwar said. ``What Gelbard has been up to has been
the straw that has broken the camel's back.'' 

Gelbard was not available for comment Monday, but in the past has
maintained that the United States still strongly supports democratic
reforms in Indonesia. 

Anwar and others warn that anti-American sentiment could rise,
particularly among Wahid's political opponents, who are pressing for
his resignation. 

``But just remember, if relations are allowed to deteriorate any
further, Indonesia and its people have far more to lose than the
United States does,'' The Jakarta Post said in an editorial Monday.
The United States gives Indonesia millions of dollars in aid and is
a major market for the country's exports. 

President Wahid initially enjoyed warm relations with the United
States. As Indonesia's first democratically chosen head of state in
four decades, he visited Clinton twice at the White House, and
Washington has been a strong supporter of International Monetary
Fund aid to Indonesia. 

However, relations became strained after Wahid's commitment to
reform appeared to waver. They deteriorated further when Wahid made
an official visit to Cuba. He has also announced plans to travel to
Iraq.
