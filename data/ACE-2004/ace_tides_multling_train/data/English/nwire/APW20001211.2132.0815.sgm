Major League Soccer Wins Lawsuit

BOSTON (AP) _ Major League Soccer scored a victory over its players
on Monday when a jury decided that the league was not a monopoly
with the power to depress salaries. 

The class-action antitrust lawsuit filed in federal court claimed
that MLS owners conspired with the U.S. Soccer Federation to
eliminate competition for Division I soccer players. 

But after about a day of deliberation, the jury found that plenty of
competition existed _ in Europe, in Latin America, and in minor and
indoor leagues in the United States. 

``We couldn't have told the players, 'Take it or leave it,' because
they had other places to go,'' said Michael Cardozo, an attorney for
MLS. 

The players will appeal the verdict, attorney Jeffrey Kessler said. 

Jurors told The Associated Press that they were impressed by the
testimony of former deputy commissioner Sunil Gulati, who compiled a
chart noting that MLS players had come from and gone to professional
leagues in dozens of other countries. 

But the players argued that only 20 percent of MLS players had
international options. Others were turned away because of visa and
work-permit requirements or other limits on the use of foreign
players. 

``All we want is an agreement between labor and management,'' said
Garth Lagerway, the Miami Fusion goalkeeper and player
representative. ``All that's happened in the history of this league
is the league telling us what we had to accept.'' 

Because the jury sided with the owners that the market was not
limited to Division I soccer in this country, it did not have to
answer any of the other questions. 

At the heart of the players' case was the claim that, if not for the
exclusion of other Division I leagues, there could be a thriving
marketplace for soccer leagues and players in this country. 

However, the jury found that two topflight leagues would
oversaturate the limited American interest in the sport. 

``It was our feeling that if these two leagues had been in place,
both would be bankrupt,'' juror Tina Hart told the AP. ``There isn't
enough demand for it.'' 

MLS owners claimed that they have lost $250 million since 1995, even
without competition. A decision against them would have been tripled
under antitrust law and then applied to other players in the class,
which could have put it into the tens of millions of dollars. 

The case had been closely watched at the start when players claimed
that the ``single-entity'' structure of the league _ a centralized
ownership mimicked by every new sports league formed since MLS _ was
itself an antitrust violation. 

That claim was thrown out before trial. Kessler said it would be
appealed, along with this jury's verdict. 

But Monday's decision is a setback for the players in that case as
well. The league has argued that the jury's definition of the market
will apply to _ and undercut _ that case as well.
