PISCATAWAY, N.J. (AP) _ Terry Shea, who failed to produce a winning
season in four-plus years at Rutgers, will step down as coach at the
end of this season, a source close to the school told The Associated
Press Friday. 

Shea, who has an 11-41 record, agreed to resign after meeting with
athletic director Robert E. Mulcahy on Thursday afternoon, according
to the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 

The Star-Ledger of Newark, Gannett Newspapers and The Record of
Hackensack reported Friday that Shea agreed to resign. 

Mulcahy and Shea signed off on his resignation around 7:30 p.m., and
Shea then held a meeting with his football team at 9:30 p.m., the
source said. 

Rutgers athletic director Robert E. Mulcahy called a news conference
for Friday at noon EST. 

``That's when it will happen,'' the source said. 

Telephone calls to Mulcahy and Rutgers sports information director
John Wooding by The Associated Press were not immediately returned. 

The Scarlet Knights are 3-5 overall and 0-5 in the Big East
Conference. They have a bye this weekend, then finish the season
with games against West Virginia, Notre Dame and Syracuse. 

After Rutgers posted a 1-10 record last season, Mulcahy told Shea he
had to have a winning record this season and the team had to avoid
the one-sided losses that embarrassed the school in recent years. 

After opening the season with wins over Villanova, a Division IAA
program, and Buffalo, which recently announced its coach would not
be returning next season, Rutgers lost its next five games by a
combined 232-43 margin. 

The skid ended last week with a victory over winless Navy. 

Shea replaced the fired Doug Graber in 1996 with hopes of building a
program with a Bill Walsh-type West Coast offense. 

Shea never got the talent to make it happen. He posted records of
2-9, 0-11, 5-6 and 1-10. His five wins in 1998 after going winless
the year before were enough to earn him Big East Coach of the Year. 

Rutgers was 4-29 in Big East play during Shea's tenure, including
1-16 in league road games. The Scarlet Knights gave up 40 or more
points in 23 games under Shea. 

Shea has one year remaining on his contract, which has a base salary
of $160,000. 

Rutgers reportedly had started compiling a short list of candidates
to replace Shea. It includes head coaches Gary Darnell of Western
Michigan, Gary Pinkel of Toledo and two coordinators _ Miami
defensive coordinator Greg Schiano and Notre Dame offensive
coordinator Kevin Rogers.
