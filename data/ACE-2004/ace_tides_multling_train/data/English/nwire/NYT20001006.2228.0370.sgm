The vice-presidential debate on Thursday between Sen. Joseph
Lieberman and Dick Cheney was watched by at least 28.5 million
people, the second-smallest audience on record for a
vice-presidential debate, according to Nielsen Media Research data. 

The lowest-rated vice-presidential debate on record was the
confrontation between Vice President Al Gore and Jack Kemp, on Oct.
9, 1996. It was watched by 26.6 million people. 

The highest-rated vice-presidential debate was the matchup between
Rep. Geraldine Ferraro and Vice President George Bush, on Oct. 11,
1984. It was watched by 56.7 million people. 

Nielsen executives said it was possible that the final audience
tally for Thursday's confrontation could be slightly larger than the
one released Friday. The ratings gathering process was complicated
by Fox's decision to show a baseball playoff game instead of the
debate. Some of its affiliated stations showed the debate later in
the evening, and Nielsen said it would not be able to count the
number of people who watched those showings until early next week.
The difference was not expected to be very significant. 

Thursday's estimated audience included viewers who watched on ABC,
CBS, NBC, MSNBC, CNN and the Fox News Channel.
