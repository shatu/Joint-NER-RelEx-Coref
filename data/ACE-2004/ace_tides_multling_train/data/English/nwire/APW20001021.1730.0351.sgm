Germans Demonstrate Against Hate

DORTMUND, Germany (AP) _ Thousands of Germans joined together in
this western city Saturday to protest foreigner hate, the extreme
right and a neo-Nazi demonstration. 

``This event shall serve as a beacon for the uprising of concerned
people,'' said North Rhine-Westphalia governor Wolfgang Clement,
alluding to Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's call for ordinary Germans
to speak out against a recent wave of hate. 

Organizers said 20,000 people attended the event in Dortmund, an
industrial center in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous
state. 

Later, about 600 neo-Nazis marched through the middle of town under
heavy police guard. Three officers were injured as leftist
counter-demonstrators tried to break through police lines, and two
leftists and two neo-Nazis were arrested. 

Counter-demonstrations against rightist events are common in
Germany. But the events have taken on a more urgent tone because of
a recent wave of awareness of hate-fueled violence that followed a
still-unsolved bomb attack late July in North Rhine-Westphalia's
capital Duesseldorf. That attack left 10 recent immigrants injured,
at least six of them Jews, and at least three people were killed in
other hate attacks over the summer. 

In the latest attack Friday night, an Algerian asylum-seeker was
stabbed in the arm following an argument about Germans and
foreigners with two men, aged 19 and 20. 

Dortmund authorities had tried to ban the Saturday neo-Nazi march,
but a court late Friday evening ruled that it could go on. 

Clement said the counter-demonstration _ organized by citizens'
groups, political parties, sport clubs, students and teachers _ was
the kind of involvement by society that would help ``again rub out
from our country the brown specter from our past,'' referring to the
Nazis' infamous brownshirts. 

Government efforts to stop neo-Nazis have focused on banning the
small, far-right National Democratic Party, blamed for fueling some
of the violence. On Friday, interior ministers meeting in Berlin
delayed a decision on seeking a ban before Germany's highest court. 

Bavaria Interior Minister Guenther Beckstein, one of the leading
proponents of a ban, told Focus newsmagazine in an interview
Saturday that he was ``firmly convinced'' a legal motion would still
be filed this year. He also raised the possibility of seeking bans
about Germany's other far-right parties _ the Republicans and German
Peoples Union _ both of which have had far more electoral success
than the politically insignificant NPD. 

Some have criticized a potential party ban for it they would only
drive party members underground and make them harder to monitor.
Christian Worch of Hamburg, the neo-Nazi who led the Saturday
demonstration, gave support to that view. 

``Every ban makes us stronger and more alive,'' he told protesters.
