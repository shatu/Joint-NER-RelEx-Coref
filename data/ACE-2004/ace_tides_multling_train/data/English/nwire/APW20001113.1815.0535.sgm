Presidential Ballots in Denmark

COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ A Danish couple were surprised this
weekend when two absentee ballots from the U.S. presidential
election turned up in their mail. 

Brian Kain, a 33-year-old accountant and sailing enthusiast, eagerly
opened a large envelope when it arrived Saturday with some
information about navigation charts that he had ordered from a
company based in the state of Washington. 

He assumed two extra sealed yellow envelopes inside the package were
ads and planned to throw them away until his wife, Helle, opened one
of them to discover the absentee ballot of Steven H. Forrester of
Bellevue, Wash. 

``The most interesting thing to me was the free chart and the
brochure,'' said Kain. 

The Kains didn't open the second envelope but assumed it also was a
ballot since both were marked with the words ``Official ballot _ do
not delay.'' 

They contacted the U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen on Monday and were
asked to put the envelopes in the mail. Embassy spokeswoman Lela
Margiou said they were waiting to receive the ballots and had not
yet decided what to do with them. 

``It's kind of unusual,'' Margiou said, adding that the ballots
``were not valid, were not meaningful because counting in Washington
State has been completed.'' 

Kain had ordered the information via the Internet from Tides End
Ltd. of Washington. The large envelope, which was postmarked from
Shaw Island, arrived unsealed at the Kains' home in Odense, 105
miles west of the capital, Copenhagen. 

The Fyens Stiftstidende, the main local newspaper, said it contacted
Forrester to tell him his ballot had landed in Denmark and he did
not understand how it could have been postmarked in Shaw Island, 50
miles from where his wife mailed it in Bellevue. 

Forrester told the newspaper he had no plans of pursuing the matter. 

``The vote is, I think, over,'' he was quoted as saying. 

The U.S. presidential race between Republican nominee Texas Gov.
George W. Bush and Democratic Vice President Al Gore remained
undecided Monday with the state of Florida's 25 electoral votes
still at stake.
