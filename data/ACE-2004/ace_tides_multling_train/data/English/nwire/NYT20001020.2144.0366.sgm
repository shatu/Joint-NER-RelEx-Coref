UNDATED: he added. &LR; &HT; As with credit insurance, internal
documents from Associates suggest that employees have been pressured
to encourage homeowners and other borrowers to refinance loans; the
emphasis was usually on how this would benefit the company, not on
how it might help the customer.

In the ``Roadmap'' memo, for example, a chart showed how the
profitability of a consumer loan decreases as it ages. ``You can see
how the earnings decline over time,'' the memo said. ``Your
controller can provide lists to you of aged personal loans to target
for renewal.'' 

Another memo, sent in 1991 to ``all branch managers,'' concerned
Associates' practice of acquiring consumer loans made by other
lenders or retailers. ``The principal reason we purchase an
acquisition is to convert it to a more profitable loan,'' the memo
stated. ``If we cannot convert acquisitions, we cannot continue to
purchase them.'' 

The memo then stipulated that employees who renewed such loans, if
secured by real estate, would receive a $100 bonus for each loan. 

Last month, in an investor conference call, Keith W. Hughes, the
chief executive of Associates, who will join Citigroup as a vice
chairman after the merger, cited the strong cultural similarities
between the companies. But in an interview last week, Marge Magner,
a Citigroup executive who previously oversaw Citigroup's consumer
finance business, stressed what she said were big differences,
particularly in how the sales staff is paid. 

Associates bases pay on the volume of loans that employees generate,
a ``count your transactions'' approach, Magner said. At
Citifinancial, she said, ``we deal with the business as a whole, the
whole branch and how it's growing.'' 

She also emphasized that the Citifinancial computer system used by
the sales staff automatically rejected products and interest rate
levels that did not seem suitable for a specific customer, giving
Citifinancial a measure of centralized control over lending
practices. ``A lot of the compliance issues are built into the
system,'' she said.
