Lieberman Holds Environment Dear 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WAUSAU, Wis. (AP) _ Democratic vice presidential candidate Joseph
Lieberman said Wednesday that to him and Al Gore, protecting the
environment is ``a matter of faith.'' 

``The environment is the work of God,'' Lieberman told about 500
people at Bluegill Bay Park. 

Lieberman kept the pressure on Texas Gov. George W. Bush's
environmental record with his visit to this battleground state the
day after Gore and Republican Bush tangled in their third and final
presidential debate. 

A day earlier in Little Rock, Ark., Lieberman said Houston has ``the
dirtiest air in America.'' 

``Texas has the most industrial air pollution of any state in the
country, has the third worst water pollution,'' he said. ``I hope
Governor Bush doesn't want to do for America what he's done for
Texas.'' 

Polls show that Wisconsin and its 11 electoral votes are up for
grabs. While Vice President Gore has led in the most recent polls,
his advantage has been within the margin of error. 

In Arkansas, Lieberman also told about 700 supporters that he and
Gore would sustain the country's economic boom and that Bush would
return the country to a time of deficits and recession. 

He cited statistics showing improvements in the past eight years
under Gore and President Clinton, including 22 million new jobs,
smaller welfare rolls, and decreased crime rates. He ended each
example with the refrain, ``We're not going back. We're going to
keep going forward.'' 

Lieberman, an observant Jew who has argued for a greater role for
religious faith in public life, has framed his arguments in recent
days as a difference in fundamental values. 

``It's about our values of freedom and fairness and equal
opportunity that have always defined us as Americans. Now more than
ever we cannot afford to waste the talents of a single person. We
can't afford to go back to the failed policies of the past,'' he
said. 

Lieberman also was traveling to Baltimore later in the day to attend
Democratic Party fund-raisers and then to New York for an appearance
Thursday on the daytime talk-show ``Live With Regis,'' followed by a
speech to the League of Conservation Voters. 

He said Tuesday's presidential debate ``might have been a turning
point in the election.'' 

``I thought finally it clarified the differences in these two
tickets and I think that's what the American people have been
waiting for. I think clearly a lot of people are swinging back and
forth. They were uncertain and they were waiting for some clarity.
And I just think on the important issues of who is best able to
continue America's prosperity, Al Gore is,'' Lieberman said.
