NEW YORK _ Bread pudding is one of the most traditional American
dishes; cookbooks from the 18th century have recipes for it that are
more or less the same as what we make today. 

But bread pudding is also a minimalist sort of dish, no more than
dry bread mixed together with milk and eggs and whatever flavor
strikes the cook, and then baked until it is rich and custardy. It
can be savory or sweet, and either makes a simple, interesting
substitute for a standard part of the Thanksgiving meal. 

Savory bread pudding is a luxurious side dish that can be served in
place of stuffing. Or it can be the extra stuffing that everyone
always wants (but not dry like the usual kind baked outside a turkey
can be). 

My basic recipe combines the cubed bread, eggs and milk with a
couple of cheeses. (If you're desperate for oven space, bake it and
then heat it just before serving, or serve it at room temperature.)
You can make it without the mushrooms, too. 

The pudding can also be varied by adding a pinch of thyme or sage,
chopped nuts or cooked chestnuts, or about a cup of grated sweet
potato or chopped scallions. If you want a pudding that tastes more
like stuffing, just add chopped celery, onions, carrots and herbs. 

Sweet bread pudding is made the same way, but with fewer
ingredients. I use maple syrup instead of sugar for the extra flavor
and moisture. You can add more spices, including a small grating of
nutmeg, chopped crystallized ginger, raisins or prunes soaked in
Armagnac. 

The kind of bread you choose makes a difference. Fluffy packaged
white bread disappears; the crusts of crisp baguettes and peasant
breads never become tender. For savory pudding, stick to long, wide
inexpensive loaves, usually called Italian bread; for sweet pudding,
stale hallah is best. And make sure the bread is thoroughly and
evenly soaked before it's baked; I like to submerge the bread with a
weighted plate before baking. Then you don't even have to stir. 

&UR; SWEET BREAD PUDDING &LR; 

&UR; Time: 1 hour, largely unattended &LR; 

4 tablespoons butter 

6 cups white bread, cut or torn into 1-inch chunks 

2 cups half-and-half 

4 eggs 

} cup maple syrup or sugar 

{ teaspoon cinnamon 

Pinch salt. 

1. Butter an 8-inch souffle or baking dish, and add bread. Cut
remaining butter into bits, and combine with all other ingredients;
pour over bread. Submerge bread with weighted plate, and turn oven
to 350 degrees. 

2. When oven is hot, remove the plate and bake until pudding is just
set, 35 to 45 minutes. Serve with or without whipped cream. 

Yield: 6 or more servings. 

Variation: To make chocolate bread pudding, melt 2 ounces chopped
bittersweet chocolate in the milk, let cool slightly and add to
mixture.
