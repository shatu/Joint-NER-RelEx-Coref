Airbus: China Needs 1,600 Planes 
</HEADLINE>

BEIJING (AP) _ China will need almost 1,600 new aircraft over the
next two decades to meet its goals for growth in air travel, Airbus
Industrie said Tuesday. 

Passenger traffic on Chinese carriers will grow at an annual rate of
7.7 percent until the end of 2019, requiring them to triple their
number of seats from 97,000 to about 380,000, the European aircraft
consortium said. 

To keep up, Airbus estimated China's 19 airlines will need 1,570 new
passenger planes and 26 new cargo carriers at a total cost of $149
billion. 

The China market's anticipated growth far outpaces an expected
worldwide 4.9 percent annual rise in passenger traffic over the next
two decades, according to Airbus.
