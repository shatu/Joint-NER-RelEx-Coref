JACKSON, Wyo. (AP) _ A plane carrying actress Sandra Bullock and
three other people missed a runway and crashed at the Jackson Hole
Airport early Wednesday. Authorities said no one was hurt. 

Bullock, who stars in the current ``Miss Congeniality,'' was aboard
the plane with two crew members and another person, airport manager
George Larson said. He said all were uninjured. 

The twin-engine Hawker corporate jet, owned by RR Investments of
Texas, was heavily damaged. The main nose landing gear was sheared
off and both wings were extensively damaged, Larson said. 

The plane landed between a runway and taxiway at the airport in
northwestern Wyoming about 1:30 a.m. 

Blizzard conditions and a high cross wind made landing more
difficult than usual, authorities said. 

The harsh weather may have disoriented the pilot, Richard Campbell,
of Fort Worth, Texas, causing him to mistake a set of ground lights
for the center of the runway, airport officials said. 

The four climbed out of the wreckage and found the airport was
empty. ``So they walked in here and found a custodian, and she
called some other people who called the sheriff's department,''
Larson said. 

A similar accident occurred last winter when a private airplane
landed in the same spot. Larson said the airport plans to install
new runway lights.
