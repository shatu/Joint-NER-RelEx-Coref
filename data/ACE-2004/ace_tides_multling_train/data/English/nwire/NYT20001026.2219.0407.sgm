Back in the pre-cable heyday of UHF you could occasionally find, in
the wee hours of the morning, a bafflingly obscure, strangely arty
kind of horror film, which starred nobody you recognized and which
made, even through the haze of insomnia, very little sense. This
murky genre survives mostly on the USA cable network and in the
straight-to-video market, but with ``The Sculptress'' it surfaces _
briefly, one assumes _ in theatrical release. The movie's relative
restraint when it comes to gore, nudity and bad language makes
late-night broadcast television its ideal venue, as does its air of
solemn boredom. 

Katie Wright plays Sarah, a British art student studying in San
Francisco, where she happens to live next door to a serial killer
(Jeff Fahey) who dons outlandish costumes to stalk his victims. To
make matters worse _ not so much for Sarah as for the audience _
this troubled fellow is not just your run-of-the-mill sexually
frustrated, split-personality slasher but some kind of evil spirit
who has, perhaps unwittingly, infiltrated his neighbor's mind. 

It takes a panicky fortune teller and a kindly (if vaguely
lecherous) sculpture professor to figure this out _ the professor
draws a helpful diagram featuring words like ``incubus'' and ``demon
child'' _ but they can't do much to help poor Sarah, who must also
fend off the advances of an aggressive classmate, struggle with the
demands of her art and, in her modest contribution to the film's
doomy atmosphere, light candles in a dim, spooky church. 

Meanwhile, her neighbor, when he's not reciting ``Hamlet'' in his
apartment, dresses up as some kind of 19th-century German baron,
complete with fake beard, walking stick and kid gloves _ the kind of
get-up women in San Francisco apparently find irresistible. 

``The Sculptress'' is so poorly written, badly acted and ineptly
directed that it denies you even the modest pleasure of making fun
of it. Since you know the identity of the killer well in advance,
and since Wright's dull pouting and slack line-reading make it
impossible to care what happens to her character, the only real
mystery is why this film was ever made. 

``The Sculptress'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent
or adult guardian). It contains brief sexual scenes and some gore.
