Gisela Kahn Gresser, a pioneer in women's chess and a nine-time
national champion, died Dec. 4 in her New York home. She was 94. 

Gresser, who was born in 1906 in Detroit, taught herself to play
chess using a book that a fellow passenger gave her on a cruise in
1939. 

She was at the forefront of women's chess in the United States for
more than three decades. She and a handful of other women, including
Sonja Graf Stevenson, Mary Bain and Mona May Karff, dominated
tournament competition from the 1940s to the 1970s. 

Gresser entered her first chess competition in 1940. In 1944, she
won her first U.S. Women's Chess Championship. 

She went on to win the championship eight more times, and became the
first woman in the United States to earn a master's rating. In 1950,
she was also awarded an international woman master title. 

Throughout her career, Gresser represented the United States in
several international events. She played in five Women's Candidates
tournaments and three Women's Chess Olympiads. She was also Women's
World Chess Championship challenger in 1949 and 1950. 

She retired from professional chess at 82. In 1992 she became the
first woman inducted into the U.S. Chess Hall of Fame. 

Gresser studied classics as an undergraduate at Radcliffe College
and won a fellowship for classical studies at the American School of
Classical Studies in Athens, Greece. In 1927 she married William
Gresser, a New York lawyer and musicologist. He died in 1992. 

She is survived by two sons, Ion and Julian, and a brother, Julius
Kahn Jr.
