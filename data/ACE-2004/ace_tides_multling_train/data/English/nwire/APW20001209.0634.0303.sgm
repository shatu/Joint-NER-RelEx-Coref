France's Chirac Fights EU Deadlock 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NICE, France (AP) _ One after another, late into the night, the
leaders of Europe filed into a small, windowless room for private
chats with French President Jacques Chirac that could determine the
future of the European Union. 

Chirac was fighting to break a deadlock over how to modify the
15-nation EU's decision-making mechanisms to cope with its planned
expansion into the former communist East. On Saturday morning, after
he'd finished seeing the other 14 EU leaders, Chirac was scheduled
to send them a draft Treaty of Nice _ a blueprint for running the
bloc of 370 million people as it prepares for a dozen new members. 

His efforts, which took place in the midst of a crucial three-day EU
summit in this French resort city, were a step toward the agreement
that everyone gathered here says is necessary _ but nobody thinks
will be easy. 

``Everybody has to be prepared to take a step toward compromise,''
Chirac told a news conference as he prepared to host the talks. 

Failure to find an agreement before the summit ends could push the
EU into a prolonged crisis and dash the hopes of Poles, Hungarians,
Czechs and others seeking to join the EU over the next two or three
years. 

Painfully aware of the high stakes, leaders were hopeful an
agreement could be reached as the summit, which started Thursday,
drags on through the weekend. 

``I don't want to speculate about failure,'' Swedish Prime Minister
Goeran Persson told reporters after his 15-minute meeting with
Chirac. ``I don't think that is in the cards. All political logic
tells me we'll finally find an agreement over how to distribute
power.'' 

Chirac has a particular problem. As the EU's current chairman, he's
supposed to broker a compromise. But he's also defending France's
corner in a fight with Germany _ the summit's knottiest problem. 

Although every nation is fighting to maximize its voice in the
reformed union, other leaders believe summit success hinges on
resolving the wrangle between Paris and Berlin over who controls the
most votes in the EU's policy-setting councils. 

Germany, its population swollen to 82 million by reunification,
wants its voting weight increased to reflect its position as the
EU's biggest nation. France says that strikes at the heart of
postwar Franco-German parity, which formed the foundation of
Europe's drive for unity. 

Paris defends a status quo that gives Germany equal voting rights
with France, Italy and Britain even though they each have fewer than
60 million citizens. Meanwhile, smaller nations are struggling to
avoid having their rights overwhelmed by the maneuvers of the ``big
four.'' 

Although no early breakthrough was in sight, leaders hinted the
group was edging toward a deal. 

``I came away reasonably optimistic,'' French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin said after one round of talks Thursday. ``We can't say there
was movement, but maybe there was a willingness to move.'' 

Suggestions of compromise appeared on the contentious issue of how
many seats each nation has on the EU's executive body, the European
Commission. 

To prevent the Commission from becoming top-heavy after the
expansion, bigger nations have agreed to give up their second seat,
so all will have one each. Plans to go beyond that, to introduce a
rotation where some would be temporarily without a seat, were likely
to be shelved. 

A compromise also seemed likely on another central issue _ replacing
unanimous voting with majority decisions on a number of issues,
including transport and environmental protection. But unanimous
decisions were expected to remain the rule on the most sensitive
topics, such as taxation, immigration and social security. 

Despite the guarded confidence, the leaders were aware that hours _
possibly days _ of grueling negotiations were likely still ahead of
them after they receive Chirac's treaty draft with their breakfast
croissants Saturday. 

Meanwhile, few felt like jeopardizing the negotiations by going
public with the details. 

``We are in clerical sessions. You know about the secret of the
confessional, and so I can't comment,'' Spanish Foreign Minister
Josep Pique said.
