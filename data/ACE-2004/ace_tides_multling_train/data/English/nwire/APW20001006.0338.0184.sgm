TV Pundits Give Debate High Marks

LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The Dick Cheney-Joe Lieberman debate was praised
by some TV commentators as an exercise in good manners and condemned
by others as bad politics. 

``Highly civilized, in many ways they articulated the positions of
their campaigns more effectively than the top of their ticket when
they met in Boston,'' Tom Brokaw said. 

``Give it a rave,'' said CBS anchor Dan Rather. This will go down as
the best vice presidential joint appearance on television since the
television era in presidential and vice presidential campaigns
began.'' 

His colleague, Bob Schieffer, wondered whether their ``bosses,''
George W. Bush and Al Gore, were watching. 

Instant polls and in-studio audiences also gave the vice
presidential candidates high marks. 

But some observers pronounced themselves frustrated by the debate.
Fox News Channel's Mort Kondracke called it ``an opportunity wasted
by Cheney to go after Gore.'' 

``Maybe somebody could have given the candidates a hot foot or put a
joy buzzer on their seat,'' said his colleague, Fred Barnes. 

Conservative commentator Bill Kristol, also on FNC, said ``the Bush
campaign failed to do what it had to do ... which to assault al
Gore's policies and his credibility.'' 

ABC's Sam Donaldson asked plaintively when it was decreed that
campaigners had to act like ``gentlemen and ladies.'' 

``I think that's nonsense,'' Donaldson said. 

The night was put in perspective. ABC anchorman Peter Jennings, who
noted that ``bottom of the ticket'' doesn't necessarily have that
much affect on voter decisions. 

NBC's Tim Russert of predicted the veep debate's ``effect on the
election will practically be nonexistent.'' 

A group of undecided voters recruited by NBC in Tampa, Fla., were
impressed with both candidates _ and, with a non-show of hands, all
indicated they remained on the fence. 

On Tuesday, an estimated 46.5 million people watched the first
presidential debate between Gore and Bush, which some commentators
deemed rancorous. 

Lieberman and Cheney were probably on their best behavior because
focus groups told the campaigns that conflict doesn't pay,
commentators mused. 

That Gore-Bush audience was comparable to the 46.1 million people
who watched the first duel between President Clinton and Bob Dole
four years ago, but fell short of the all-time record: 80 million
people watched President Carter and Ronald Reagan square off in
1980. 

Cheney and Lieberman, with moderator Bernie Shaw, met at Centre
College in Danville, Ky., for their only debate. Bush and Gore have
two more debates scheduled, on Oct. 11 and 17.
