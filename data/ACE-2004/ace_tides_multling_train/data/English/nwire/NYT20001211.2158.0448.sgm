When David Cone heard about the Mets filling out their pitching
rotation Monday _ and ending their interest in signing him _ he was
already considering a proposition to work as a late-inning reliever
for the Kansas City Royals. 

Cone, the former Yankees right-hander, received a telephone call
Sunday night from his former teammate George Brett, currently vice
president for baseball operations with the Royals. He asked Cone if
he would be interested in being a setup man or a closer for Kansas
City. 

``It's intriguing,'' Cone said. ``It got me thinking. I have to give
it some thought, because I've been a starter.'' 

Cone, a Kansas City native, was originally signed by the Royals and
broke into the majors with the team. 

The Mets had little contact with Cone's agent before they signed the
pitchers Kevin Appier and Steve Trachsel on Monday. ``I wish I
would've had a chance to talk to them face to face,'' said Cone, who
believes his options will become clearer after the winter meetings
are over. 

The Boston Red Sox and Baltimore Orioles are among the other teams
expressing interest in Cone.
