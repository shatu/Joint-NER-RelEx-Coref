Hewlett-Packard To Pay German Fees 
</HEADLINE>

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Computer giant Hewlett-Packard Corp. has
become the first company to be snagged by a German law requiring
firms to pay fees for making CD burners that are being used to
illegally lift the latest hits off the World Wide Web. 

The case sets the stage for other European countries to possibly
adopt similar rules to stem an epidemic that cost the music industry
an estimated $5 billion last year. But analysts blasted the
agreement reached Thursday as another example of Germany's notorious
thatch of regulations. 

``The manufacturers are scapegoats,'' said Robert Labatt, a new
media analyst at research group Gartner. ``It's the individual works
of art, books, songs, videos, that need to be protected.'' 

Many of Germany's neighbors, including France, Italy and Greece,
have similar laws meant to protect authors and musicians by nailing
makers of equipment used to violate copyright laws. But the laws
date back decades and focus on devices like tape recorders and video
players. 

The German case against Hewlett-Packard extends Germany's
pre-existing law into the digital age, when such things as CD
burners, computer printers, hard drives and high-speed modems make
it easier to copy and transfer copyrighted items. 

According to the International Federation of the Phonographic
Industry, about 500 million CDs are pirated annually by people
creating their own CDs from downloaded tunes off the Internet. More
than 25 million pirated music files are available online, the group
estimates. 

All told, that racked up a $1 billion for Europe's $10 billion music
industry last year, and cost EU governments around $72 million in
lost tax revenues, the group says. 

Several lawsuits have been filed around the world, including an
ongoing lawsuit a number of record companies have brought against
Napster Inc., whose software allows users to easily swap music
files. 

GEMA, German's main licensing group, targeted Hewlett-Packard as a
test case in May, reasoning that the company leads the German market
leader in CD burners. But Hewlett-Packard dug in its heels when it
was ordered to pay 30 marks ($12.90) for each CD burner sold in
Germany since February 1998. 

The legal battle continued until Thursday, when an agreement was
reached to have Hewlett-Packard pay 3.60 marks ($1.54) for each unit
sold during that period while agreeing to pay 12 marks ($5.16) for
each one sold in the future. 

Hewlett-Packard spokeswoman Jeannette Weisschuh refused to say how
much that would set the company back. But she criticized the
settlement for putting Hewlett-Packard at a disadvantage against
foreign online retailers who, unburdened by such fees, can sell
cheaper CD burners. 

``This was a trial to set an example for the whole market,'' said
Weisschuh. ``It's unfair to the consumers who have to pay more and
unfair to the manufacturers because it gives us a competitive
disadvantage.'' 

Other companies selling CD burners in Germany will also be subject
to the fees, which could vary depending on what kind of agreement
they reach with GEMA. The Hewlett-Packard settlement is expected to
set a benchmark, however. 

Currently, equipment manufacturers pay 2.50 marks ($1.07) for each
cassette recorder and 18 marks ($7.74) for each video recorder sold
in Germany. The fees, which are not collected by the government, are
distributed by GEMA to copyright owners through recording houses and
music distributors.
