TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ After throwing barbs at all the other
presidential candidates, Scott Dailey, a member of the school board
here, introduced Pat Buchanan to a luncheon audience Thursday by
joshing: ``Pat says he is a serious candidate. The polls say he is
dead serious.'' 

It is an assessment that Buchanan, the Reform Party candidate, does
not strenuously dispute. 

While many in political circles believe that Ralph Nader could
affect the outcome of the election next week by draining votes away
from Vice President Al Gore in crucial states, possibly even
Florida, hardly anyone, least of all Buchanan, believes the Buchanan
candidacy will be decisive. 

He does not have much support in the first place, as Dailey's
introduction implied. And the support he does have, Buchanan feels,
is as likely to be drawn from Gore as from Bush. 

A New York Times/CBS News poll taken statewide last week showed
Buchanan with 1 percent of the vote in Florida. He is apparently not
doing much better anywhere else in the country. 

At a news conference here Thursday, Buchanan said one problem he
faced was his lack of support from conservative Republicans. 

``The great driving factor of conservatives,'' he said, ``is to get
rid of Al Gore.'' 

Many of those who will vote for him, Buchanan said, would probably
not bother to vote if he were not in the race. Others, he said, are
``social conservative Republicans.'' Still others are blue-collar
Democrats who like his protectionist trade policies because they
fear their jobs could go overseas. 

When Bush and Gore are in Florida, they talk about Social Security,
Medicare, taxes and education. In speeches like the one he gave
Thursday to the Tiger Bay Club downtown, Buchanan talked about
issues that the other candidates skip: immigration, the culture war,
school prayer and international trade. 

Buchanan's television advertisements in northern Florida also deal
with issues that are not being addressed by others: English as an
official language and the right of the Boy Scouts to exclude gays. A
new advertisement depicts Gore and Bush as selling out to special
interests. 

Why is he running when he knows he has no chance to win or even
affect the outcome? ``We want to build a new third party _ a
conservative party,'' Buchanan said. One main goal, almost certainly
out of reach, is to get 5 percent of the vote nationally so that the
Reform Party can get federal matching funds in the next presidential
election. 

Here is how he described this year's presidential race: ``When you
had Goldwater versus Johnson, you had clarity. When you had Nixon
and Agnew versus McGovern, you had clarity. When you had Reagan
versus Mondale, you had clarity.'' This year, he said, the
major-party candidates campaign with a ``conscious vagueness.''
