Ivory Coast Vote Sparks Rallies

ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Long processions of cars, plastered with
candidates' posters and with horns blaring, paraded through this
coastal city Saturday, one day before presidential elections to end
10 months of military rule. 

The display of vehicles, with shouting supporters hanging out
windows, marked some of the liveliest political activity since the
campaign period began two weeks ago. 

Campaigning in Ivory Coast, once famed as an oasis of stability amid
the unrest that plagues much of West Africa, has been muted. Most
candidates _ including those from the country's two largest
political parties _ were excluded from the vote by the Supreme
Court. 

Junta leader Gen. Robert Guei, who took control during a December
coup promising he would quickly give up power, and who has close
personal ties to the chief justice of the Supreme Court, is widely
expected to win. 

``The elections are already done and people here are not
interested,'' said Ali Ouattara, a journalist in the northern city
of Korhogo, where a few torn and defaced posters were the only sign
of the approaching vote. 

While there are a total of five candidates, the only other serious
contender is Laurent Gbagbo, a history professor and longtime
opposition leader. 

The country's best-known opposition candidate, Alassane Dramane
Ouattara, was excluded by the court because of what it said were
questions about whether both his parents were of ``Ivorian origin,''
as a new junta-backed constitution requires. 

Ouattara's party, the Rally of the Republicans, and the former
ruling Democratic Party of the Ivory Coast, whose candidates were
also excluded, have both called for a boycott of the polls. 

Representatives of Rally of the Republicans set out on motorbikes
Saturday to urge villagers in the party's northern stronghold not to
cast ballots. 

``Stay in your homes, play soccer, or till the fields, but don't
vote,'' party representative Lacina Coulibaly told about 30 youths
gathered in the northern village of Lanviara, near Korhogo. 

Guei took control during the Dec. 24 coup promising he would quickly
give up power, but has since exchanged his military uniform for a
snappy suit and rallied several smaller parties around his
candidacy. 

The United Nations, the Organization of African Unity, the European
Union and countries such as the United States and Canada have
withdrawn election observers or funding to protest Guei's decision
to run and the exclusion of major opponents. 

Ivory Coast's reputation as a haven for stability and relative
wealth has been badly tarnished in recent years. Its economy has
been hobbled by a steep decline in prices for its primary exports,
cocoa and coffee, while the December coup and two subsequent
military mutinies have frightened Ivorians and foreign investors
alike.
