SPORTS COMMENTARY: BARRY BONDS' DESPERATE OCTOBER 
</HEADLINE>

If Barry Bonds is voted the Most Valuable Player in the National
League this year, he will be the first major leaguer to win it four
times. And with career totals of 494 homers and 471 stolen bases,
Bonds, the San Francisco Giants' left fielder, is the only player in
baseball history with more than 400 in each category. 

But if Reggie Jackson was Mr. October for his postseason
performances, Barry Bonds is Mr. 0 for October. 

When the Giants open their division series against the Mets in San
Francisco Wednesday, Bonds will be desperate to do what he has never
done in his various postseason appearances: hit for average, hit for
power and help his team win. More than anyone else, he knows he has
to disprove the rap that he can't hit in the big one. 

He's tried to laugh it off. ``Call me Mr. July,'' he once said. Or
feel free to call him Mr. August or Mr. September. 

When the season ended Sunday, Bonds had batted .306, crashed a
career-high 49 home runs and driven in 106 runs. 

But over 23 postseason games in his career _ 20 with the Pirates
nearly a decade ago in three losing National League Championship
Series and three with the Giants in a 1997 division series sweep by
the Florida Marlins _ Bonds has batted only .200 (16 for 80) with
only one home run, only four doubles, only five runs batted in and
16 strikeouts. 

In those three NL Championship Series, two against the Atlanta
Braves (in which he batted .148 in 1991 and .261 in '92) and one
against the Cincinnati Reds (.167 in '90), his overall average was
.191. 

Even with his overall .200 postseason average, Bonds has not even
hit his weight, 210. And his team, whether the Pirates or the
Giants, has lost 15 of those 23 postseason games. 

Over a short postseason series, even the best hitters sometimes
wallow through a slump as their team loses. Babe Ruth batted .118
(two for 17) in the five-game 1922 World Series that the Yankees
lost to the New York Giants. But over 23 postseason games, the cream
is supposed to rise to the top. Bonds' cream has only curdled. To
his dismay. 

``I want people to say,'' he has often proclaimed, ``that Barry
Bonds is the best baseball player there is.'' 

If you just assess his career regular-season stats, you can argue
that he is the best baseball player there is. 

He was named The Sporting News player of the decade for the 1990s
over Ken Griffey Jr. and Mark McGwire, joining such prestigious
names as Stan Musial ('40s), Ted Williams ('50s), Willie Mays
('60s), Pete Rose ('70s) and Mike Schmidt ('80s). In 10 years of MVP
voting in the '90s, he received the most points _ 1,895, nearly 500
more than the next highest vote-getter, Frank Thomas of the Chicago
White Sox. 

By rule, the MVP votes must be cast in the brief interlude between
the end of the regular season and the start of the playoffs. So
Bonds' postseason flops never counted against his MVP credentials. 

Those MVP votes were a tribute to the integrity of baseball writers
who cast those votes; few, if any, find Bonds to be endearing or
charming. For that matter, few of his teammates have enjoyed his
arrogant, haughty personality. 

``I'd rather lose without him,'' one of his Pirate teammates said,
requesting anonymity, ``than win with him.'' 

Bonds hasn't changed. Many of his Giant teammates hardly talk to
him. Or want to. In the Giants' spacious clubhouse at their new
Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco, he prefers to be alone. He
spreads out across four lockers. He sprawls in a recliner and
watches his own television set or listens to his stereo. 

``Some people accuse me of having a chip on my shoulder,'' he once
said, ``but that's part of what makes me tick.'' 

But more than anyone else, Bonds knows he has not ticked in the
postseason. He's due to break out with a barrage against the Mets;
then again, the Mets' pitchers know that, in his desperation to show
that he really is the ``best player there is,'' he might be willing
to swing at pitches he might ignore during the regular season. If he
does swing at those pitches, that should be to the Mets' advantage,
not his. 

``If you know me,'' Barry Bonds once said, ``I always find something
that I have to prove.'' 

In this postseason, he has to prove that he's much more than a .200
hitter.
