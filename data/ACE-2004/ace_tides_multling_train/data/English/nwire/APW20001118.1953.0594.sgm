Callers Admonish Ventura

ST. PAUL (AP) _ Gov. Jesse Ventura's weekly radio show has been
flooded with calls about his new part-time job as a football
commentator. 

``You belong to the people, 100 percent, 24-hours-a-day, seven days
a week,'' one caller admonished Friday. Others said his association
with the XFL _ a rough-and-tumble league organized by NBC and the
World Wrestling Federation _ degraded his office. 

Ventura brushed aside the criticism, saying he would stop if the XFL
becomes too raunchy or he deems it in ``any way unacceptable to my
position as governor.'' 

Meanwhile, Democratic state Sen. Ellen Anderson said she would
introduce a bill to make the job of governor a part-time position,
similar to state lawmaker positions. 

``It would fit in (Ventura's) political philosophy and it would take
away the criticism of him taking outside jobs,'' she said. 

In a contract announced Thursday, the former wrestler agreed to work
10 Saturday night games starting in February. He can miss them if
state business demands it.
