ROME _ In an encounter bracketed by political clashes and public
protest, Pope John Paul II met briefly on Saturday at the Vatican
with Joerg Haider, the far-right Austrian politician, who is persona
non grata to many Europeans. 

Haider, leading a group of 250 Austrians and presenting a gift of an
80-foot Christmas tree from Carinthia, the state of which he is
governor, did not receive a private audience with the pope. The
Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, explained that Haider and
Bishop Egon Kapellari of Carinthia spoke with the pope for a few
minutes before the meeting only to exchange greetings. 

But Haider, who seems to relish even hostile attention, walked
across St. Peter's Square to the Vatican from his nearby hotel
separately from the rest of the delegation, which included his wife
and two children. He was surrounded by a tense phalanx of security
officers and jostling cameramen. 

For weeks Italian Jewish groups, World War II veterans and leftist
political parties have staged protests against a meeting between the
pope and Haider, arguing that a papal encounter would lend the
Austrian politician legitimacy. On Saturday, about 1,000 students
marched in another section of central Rome, carrying banners that
read ``Haider? No thank you.'' No demonstrations were allowed near
St. Peter's, and security around the tree, which was erected in the
middle of St. Peter's Square, was discreetly tightened. 

After Haider left the area, scores of protesters clashed with riot
police, who fired tear gas to disperse the crowds. Four people were
slightly injured and two were detained, the Italian news agency ANSA
said. 

Jewish merchants in Rome announced they would turn off their lights
to protest Haider's presence in Rome. When reporters asked Haider
about this action, he retorted, ``If they want to save electricity,
let them.'' 

Inside an ornate reception room in the papal apartments, Haider, a
Roman Catholic, kissed the pope's ring and sat in the front row with
other dignitaries facing the pope's armchair. Haider wore a blue
business suit, but many in his group wore traditional costumes and
sang Christmas carols. 

The pope thanked the visitors for the tree but made no mention of
such issues as racism and immigration, which have tracked Haider's
tense visit to Italy. A copy of the pope's recently released New
Year's Day message of peace, which calls for countries to welcome
immigrants and avoid intolerance, was distributed to leaders of the
delegation. 

After the meeting, Haider told reporters that he had not discussed
political issues with the pope, that John Paul II had given the
group a ``warm welcome'' and that ``he seemed very happy with the
gift.'' 

Indeed, in the past the pope has stirred controversy by meeting with
former U.N. secretary-general Kurt Waldheim, whose activities in the
Nazi era came under question, and Fidel Castro. (BEGIN OPTIONAL

When Haider arrived in Venice earlier this week, protesters on boats
threw stones and fireworks along the canals. Haider's comments
criticizing Italy's immigration policy as ``too generous'' were
denounced by President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. The comments set off an
election campaign storm, as leaders of Italy's left-wing government
leveraged the dislike of Haider to cast a shadow on Italy's own
right-wing parties. 

The coalition of Italy's center-right opposition includes the
formerly separatist and still fiercely right-wing party, the
Northern League, which, like Haider's Freedom Party, opposes
immigration. On Friday, Prime Minister Giuliano Amato denounced
Haider's comments as ``unacceptable'' and said he would complain to
Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel of Austria. 

Italy is not the only European country to have fierce reservations
about Haider, but it has had more direct exposure. The Austrian
leader has made several visits to northern Italy, where his
friendship with some right-wing mayors _ and suggestions that
southern Austria and parts of northern Italy should merge into a
``maxi-region'' _ have enraged Italy's center-left government. (END

Some people in Haider's delegation said they were disappointed by
the clamor surrounding Saturday's visit. 

``The Christmas tree has nothing to do with politics,'' said Frank
Telsnig, 22, a teacher from Weitensfeld, as he prepared to play
saxophone in the delegation's band. ``I didn't vote for Haider, but
this is not about him. It is about Christmas, and this is not the
right place or the right time for these protests.''
