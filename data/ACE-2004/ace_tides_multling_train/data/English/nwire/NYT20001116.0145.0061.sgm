The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Nov. 16: The
last U.S. president to visit Vietnam was Richard Nixon, who traveled
to the South Vietnamese capital of Saigon in 1969, at the height of
a war that eventually took 58,000 American and 3 million Vietnamese
lives. Thursday, Bill Clinton begins a three-day trip to Hanoi and
Ho Chi Minh City, as Saigon is now called. Clinton's visit is
striking evidence of how far the two countries have moved beyond the
rancor of that conflict. But if a healthy new relationship is to be
built, Hanoi must ease bureaucratic restrictions on foreign
investment and show greater respect for the civil and religious
liberties of its people. 

Clinton's itinerary inevitably looks back to war-related issues,
like repatriating the remains of Americans lost in action and
helping remove land mines still buried in Vietnamese soil. But he
should also use his visit to press for a faster pace of political
and economic reform. 

Much has changed in Vietnam over the past three decades. Most of its
79 million people have been born since the war ended, and younger
Vietnamese, in particular, look admiringly upon American prosperity
and personal freedoms. While the Communist Party still jealously
monopolizes government power and public political debate, ordinary
Vietnamese are no longer afraid to talk about politics in private. 

But anyone who speaks out for more accountable government or wider
freedom faces stern repression. Hanoi continues to jail open
critics, persecute religious believers, censor newspapers, restrict
the Internet and otherwise suppress dissent. It routinely violates
provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights, to which it acceded in 1982, guaranteeing freedom of
expression, association and religious belief and prohibiting
arbitrary detentions. 

After a disastrous decade of trying to impose North Vietnam's
austere and repressive communism on the more freewheeling South, the
country's leaders reversed course in the late 1980s and began
encouraging Southern style entrepreneurship. But over the past three
years, Vietnam's program of market liberalization has stalled as the
country's political leaders have grown concerned about
decentralizing economic power. Foreign investors have become
frustrated with the Vietnam's bureaucratic hurdles and have taken
their investments to China and other Southeast Asian nations. 

When Clinton talks to university students in Hanoi on Friday he
should speak plainly about the merits of human rights, democracy,
free markets and the rule of law, as he did during his 1998 trip to
China. He also needs to raise these issues in his discussions with
government and Communist Party leaders as well. Establishing firm
legal protections for Vietnamese-Americans who want to return home
to do business should be an important part of his agenda. He would
also do well to follow the advice of Sen. John McCain and others and
seek to expand legal exchange programs to cover press and human
rights issues as well as commercial law.
