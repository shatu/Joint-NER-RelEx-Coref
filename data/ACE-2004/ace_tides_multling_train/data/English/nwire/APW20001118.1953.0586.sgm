Arab Women Leaders Meet

CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Ten of the Arab world's first ladies joined
activists in an unusual gathering Saturday to push for the improved
status of women in their male-dominated societies. 

Queen Rania of Jordan, Egypt's Suzanne Mubarak and others were using
their charisma and influence to campaign on behalf of women in this
three-day meeting of women leaders and campaigners for equality of
the sexes. 

``Development will not achieve its goals unless women participate in
it as complete and effective partners in all fields,'' Queen Rania
told an audience of more than 2,000 from 19 countries. She called
for ``legal and legislative reforms that achieve equality and
justice for women.'' 

Mubarak, wife of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and one of the
conference organizers, said they must find ways to respect the
social differences that distinguish Arab countries while still
cooperating to attain the summit's main goal: creating a better life
for Arab women. 

The status of women varies among countries in the Arab world.
Although women in some parts of the Persian Gulf, such as
conservative Saudi Arabia, are required to be covered from
head-to-toe and are not allowed to drive, their counterparts in more
liberal countries, including Jordan, Egypt and Lebanon, enjoy more
freedom and richer public lives. 

However, illiteracy, marginalized decision-making roles and
under-representation in politics are problems Arab women share. 

Many women, though, are struggling to change the status quo and have
achieved some gains. This year in Egypt, for example, avid
campaigning helped women reverse laws that prevented them from
obtaining divorce and traveling abroad without their husbands'
permission. 

Many of the speakers underlined the importance of meeting the
demands of the modern society while still preserving Arab identity,
traditions and beliefs. Others talked of the challenge of presenting
a more positive, well-rounded image of Arab women in the face of
negative stereotypes. 

Some attendees, however, were skeptical the gathering would reach
any strong proposals. Haifa Ezzi, a Saudi researcher interested in
women's issues, said some of the speeches ``were full of unrealistic
rhetoric.'' 

Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Algeria were the only Arab League countries
that did not send delegates to the summit. The meeting was attended
by the first ladies of Bahrain, Comoros, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait,
Lebanon, Morocco, the Palestinian territories, Sudan and Tunisia.
