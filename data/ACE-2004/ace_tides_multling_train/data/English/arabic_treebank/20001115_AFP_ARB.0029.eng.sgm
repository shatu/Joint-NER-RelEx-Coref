Bangalore (India) 11-15 (AFP) -

A government official announced today Wednesday that the Indian
deputy Rajkumar, held hostage since July 30 by the bandit Veerappan
in southern India, had been released.


Chandre Goda, the Minister for Justice and Parliamentary Affairs for
the government in the state of Karnataka, announced that "Rajkumar
has been released."


He added "he will arrive in Bangalore in the coming hours."


74-year-old Rajkumar's capture led to serious ethnic tensions in
Bangalore, the capital of the state of Karnataka.


Rajkumar, a very popular representative in this state, is from the
Kinada caste.

Veerappan is of Tamil ethnic origin.


Tamil nationalists joined the negotiations for the release of
representative Rajkumar.


Veerappan, hiding in forests in southern India, has committed over
one hundred murders, kidnappings and smuggling all kinds of
contraband, especially sandalwood and ivory.
