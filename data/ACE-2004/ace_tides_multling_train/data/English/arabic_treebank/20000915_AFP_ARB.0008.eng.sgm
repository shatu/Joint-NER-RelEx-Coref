Princess Diana's Former Secretary To Publish Controversial Book
</HEADLINE>

London 9-15 (AFP) -

Patrick Jephson, Princess Diana's secretary between 1990 and 1996,
has said that he will publish a book in October about the late
Princess' life and that it is "truthful and balanced" and not
controversial as feared by the Royal family.


Jephson, who was also Prince Charles' secretary for two years, said
that the Princess confided in him a great deal, especially in the
years preceding her divorce from the heir to the throne in 1996.


Gievson resigned from his position after Diana admitted on a
television program, which she had not informed him about, that she
had an affair with an army officer.


In a statement issued today, Friday, Jephson stressed that his book
would respect the Princess' memory who died in a road accident on
August 31, 1997 in Paris alongside her friend Dodi Fayed.


The author said: "Since her death, I have been amazed at the
worthless comments made about her, most of them incorrect and some of
them apparently intended to diminish her memory."


He stressed that the book is a "truthful and balanced account
intended as a service to the late Princess and those who worked for
her."


But his statement will probably not convince Prince Charles and Queen
Elizabeth II who will also issue a statement today expressing their
opposition to the book's publication.


Jephson said that he is aware of the anxiety of those close to Diana
as the publication date draws nearer, adding "I am confident they
will be reassured" once they read the book.
