British Airways Grounds Concorde Flights

London 8-15 (AFP) -

British Airways announced today Tuesday that all Concorde flights are
to be grounded immediately following recommendations by the air
navigation authorities.


British Airways chief executive Rod Eddington said the decision was
made because both the British and French Civil Aviation Authorities
are preparing to issue a recommendation on Wednesday suspending
flight certificates for all Concorde planes.


Eddington said the British Air Accident Investigation Branch
"notified us this morning that, in light of the latest information,
it would along with its French counterpart recommend that the
aircraft's flight certificate be suspended tomorrow (Wednesday)."


The British Airways official did not disclose the nature of the
information leading to this recommendation.


A company spokesman told Agence France Presse that it was "too early
to say" how long Concorde would be grounded.


British Airways made the decision to resume use of the Concorde
planes it owns after the Air France Concorde crash near Paris last
July 25 that killed 113 people.


Since that time, Concorde planes belonging to British Airways have
been involved in minor incidents.

British Airways and Air France are the only two companies that
operate Concorde planes.
