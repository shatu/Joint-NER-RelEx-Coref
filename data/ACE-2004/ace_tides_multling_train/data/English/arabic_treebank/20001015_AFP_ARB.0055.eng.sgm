Hizbollah Announces "Capture of Israeli Army Colonel" to Israelis
through Loudspeakers

Abad (Lebanon) 10-15 (AFP) -

Unarmed members of Lebanese Hizbollah announced news of the
fundamentalist party's "capture of an Israeli army colonel" through
loudspeakers at the Lebanese-Israeli border today Sunday.


Members of Hizbollah directed the loudspeakers from the region of
Abad, only a dozen or so kilometers from the border, toward Israeli
soldiers and relayed Hizbollah secretary-general Hassan Nasrallah's
announcement of the capture in Arabic.


The members followed the announcement with shouts in English directed
at the Israeli soldiers on the other side, saying "they are now four"
in a reference to the fundamentalist party's capture of three Israeli
soldiers eight days ago.


Members of the Ghanaian unit of the International Emergency Forces
stationed in the area limited themselves to monitoring what was
happening, which ended peacefully.


Nasrallah had announced at the opening of the Arab National Congress
and the extraordinary session of the National-Islamic Congress, held
in Beirut under the banner "Supporting the Palestinian Intifada,"
that Islamic Resistance, the fundamentalist party's armed wing, had
"succeeded in capturing an Israeli officer with the rank of colonel."


In Israel, sources close to the Israeli security forces announced
that the Hizbollah militia today Sunday "apparently" kidnapped a
former officer with the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army Militia and
not an Israeli officer.


The sources did not reveal the officer's identity or the place he was
kidnapped from.
