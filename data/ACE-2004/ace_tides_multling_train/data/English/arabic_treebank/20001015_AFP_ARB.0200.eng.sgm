Kigali 10-15 (AFP) -

A rebel army leader told Agence France Presse this evening, Sunday,
that government forces in the Democratic Republic of Congo carried
out a broad-ranging attack at the end of this week which resulted
thus far in the killing of more than 80 people.


Jean Pierre Ondikani, the leading deputy of the Rally for Congolese
Democracy, one of the biggest rebel movements supported by Uganda,
said armed government forces in the Congo and their allies carried
out an "extensive attack on all fronts" on Saturday morning.


Commander Ondikani said the attack led to more than 80 people being
killed, including fifty civilians.


He said that "since 05h00 this Saturday morning, (Congolese President
Laurent Desire) Kabila has been attacking positions in Pontaolo and
Mossawa in northern Katinga" in the southern part of the country.


He added "we have recorded seven dead and fifteen wounded among our
ranks and estimate that twenty government forces' soldiers have been
killed since the battles began."
