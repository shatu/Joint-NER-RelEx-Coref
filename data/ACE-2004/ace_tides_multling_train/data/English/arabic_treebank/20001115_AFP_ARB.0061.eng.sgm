Gaza 11-15 (AFP) -

A high-level Palestinian source said today Wednesday that the
Palestinian Superior Security Council led by President Yasser Arafat
issued orders to stop shooting inside area "A" under Palestinian
control.


The source said that "the Palestinian Superior Security Council led
by President Yasser Arafat issued orders to stop unknown armed
persons from shooting inside zone "A" under complete Palestinian
control and between buildings and civilians in the Palestinian
Territories."


The Palestinian decision comes a few hours before discussions between
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and his top security advisors to
explore the measures to be taken against Palestinians after four
Israeli soldiers were shot in Palestinian areas last Monday.
