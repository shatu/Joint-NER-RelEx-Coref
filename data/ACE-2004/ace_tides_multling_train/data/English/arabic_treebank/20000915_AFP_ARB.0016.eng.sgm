Clinton Not Concerned with Possibility of Economic Recession in the
Short or Mid-Term
</HEADLINE>

Washington 9-15 (AFP) -

American President Bill Clinton told journalists today, Friday, that
he ruled out any risk of an economic recession happening in the short
term as a result of record oil prices.


Clinton said in reply to a question by a journalist on the risk of a
recession: "The answer in the short and mid-term is no," and said he
was following developments on the oil market closely.


He described the decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to increase production to 80 thousand barrels per day and
measures taken since then as "not sufficient at present to allow the
markets to incorporate" the new situation.


The American President said he was "leaving all possibilities open"
and stressed that he would "do his very best to lessen the negative
impact of record oil prices on American consumers."


Clinton urged Congress to renew, before the end of the current
congressional session in October, the administrative authority's
jurisdiction to resort to the use of strategic oil reserves in the
event of a crisis and to endorse the tax measures, which he suggested
several years ago to no avail, to encourage cutbacks in energy
consumption and renewable energy production.
