Syrian Foreign Minister Confirms Boycott of Marseille Conference

Damascus 11-15 (AFP) -

Syria's Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shar' confirmed today Wednesday in
Damascus that he is boycotting the European-Mediterranean conference
to be held in Marseille (France) because the European Union
presidency has refused to condemn "Israeli attacks" against
Palestinians.


During a press conference, al-Shar', who was appointed coordinator
for the Arab group in the Marseille conference, announced that French
Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrun, whose country is the current
president of the European Union, informed him on the telephone that
"should a European condemnation be made, it will include both the
Israeli and Palestinian sides."


The Marseille conference takes place today and tomorrow and is meant
to include the 15 European Union countries in addition to 12
Mediterranean basin countries including Israel, but is being
boycotted by Syria and Lebanon.

This European-Mediterranean partnership is aimed at giving momentum
to cooperation in the fields of economics, culture and politics, as
well as establishing peace and stability in the Mediterranean basin.


Al-Shar' added, "we expected the European Union to condemn what is
happening in Occupied Palestine where hundreds have been killed and
thousands wounded," saying that it was "regrettable" that Arab
countries should take part in this evening's conference.


Al-Shar' continued, "I regret to say that all the Doha meetings on
the periphery of the Organization of Islamic Conference summit did
not result in a crystallization of a united Arab position toward it
(the European-Mediterranean conference). These meetings included
Syria and ministers from Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria,
Palestine and Libya."

He added, "We agreed either to go all together or not at all, and we
set a limit to which the European Union presidency did not agree."


Syria's Foreign Minister said, "We asked the European Union not to
hold a dinner during the meeting because it is not reasonable to eat
at the same table as the Israeli foreign minister (Shlomo Ben-Ami) at
a time when innocent people in Palestine are being killed.

This is not an auction."


Minister al-Shar' considered that "postponing" the
European-Mediterranean conference in Marseille would have allowed "us
to go under less tragic and bloody circumstances and would have
permitted Arab coordination and solidarity."


He said that "Lebanon and Syria not taking part in this partnership
makes it an incomplete partnership because with us, it could not
succeed, so how can it succeed without us?"


On a bilateral level, negotiations are taking place between Syria and
the European Union on a partnership agreement whose economic side is
expected, at a later date, to result in setting up a free trade zone
by 2010.
