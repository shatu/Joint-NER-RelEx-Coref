Moscow 8-15 (AFP) -

The Russian Interior Minister Vladimir Ruchalio announced today
Tuesday that over two and a half tons of explosives have been seized
in various parts of Russia since the explosion in central Moscow last
Tuesday.


Muscovite bomb expert Adolph Mishoeev told NTV television that the
explosion last Tuesday, in an underpass beneath Pushkin Square in
central Moscow, was caused by a 1.3 kg TNT time bomb.


The explosive charge consisted of a mixture of gunpowder and ammonia,
the same materials used to make the bomb which killed around 211
people in September 1999 in Moscow and other areas of Russia.


It was officially announced that an explosion in central Moscow last
Tuesday resulted in 120 casualties, including 12 deaths and 50
wounded who are still in the hospital.
