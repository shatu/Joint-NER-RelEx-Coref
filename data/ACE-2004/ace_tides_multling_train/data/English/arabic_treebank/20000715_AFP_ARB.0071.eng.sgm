Abuja 7-15 (AFP) -

The Nigerian presidency announced today Saturday that President
Olosigun Obasanjo would head for Japan next Tuesday as part of a tour
which will include South Korea and Turkey.


The source added that the delegation of officials and journalists
accompanying the president would leave Abuja this evening Saturday.


No information about the schedule has been released but it is
expected that the Nigerian president will give a speech at the Group
of Eight Summit (the seven main industrialized countries and Russia)
to be held July 21-23 in Okinawa (Japan) where he will ask for
international backing for his country's economic program.


Obasanjo will continue his campaign to reduce Nigeria's foreign debt
(in excess of 30 billion dollars).


The Nigerian president is expected to return to his country at the
end of next week after visiting South Korea and Turkey.
