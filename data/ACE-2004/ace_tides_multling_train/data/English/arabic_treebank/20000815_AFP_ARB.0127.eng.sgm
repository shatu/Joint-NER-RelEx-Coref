United Nations Resumes Humanitarian Missions to Sudan

New York (United Nations) 8-15 (AFP) -

The United Nations announced today Tuesday that it is to resume
humanitarian missions to Sudan within the next 24 hours after
missions were suspended last week as a result of the shelling of
civilian installations and aid workers.


A spokesman for the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Anan said
the Secretary-General "is happy to announce that the United Nations
will resume all its humanitarian missions to the Sudan as of
tomorrow, August 16."


Spokesman Manuel Da Almeida Silva said Anan "welcomes the guarantees
received from Sudan's president (Omar al-Bashir) that every measure
will be taken to ensure the safety of planes and workers involved in
the LifeLine Sudan project."


He added that the Secretary-General "trusts the Sudanese government
and various disputing parties to continue to keep their promise to
ensure the safety of aid workers and of vulnerable civilians whose
urgent needs the United Nations is attempting to meet."


LifeLine Sudan was set up in 1998, under an agreement between
Khartoum and the United Nations, to allow humanitarian aid to be sent
to areas ravaged by the civil war.
