Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, April 23rd

Germany's Foreign Minister, Kinkerl said that, he welcomed the NATO
ultimatum to the Serbian people of Bosnia-Herzegovina.

At the same time, he also demanded that new talks be held to end the
civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.


Kinkerl said that NATO's decision was "correct and necessary".

But, as an auxiliary method of military measures, restarting a
dialogue is also necessary.

He requested the United Nations, the European Union, the US and
Russia to put forward a new joint proposal to force both warring
parties of the Bosnia-Herzegovina to return to the negotiating table.


On the 22nd, the sixteen NATO countries asked the armed forces of the
Serbian people of Bosnia-Herzegovina to withdraw to a place 3
kilometers away from Gerlaridy city before 0:00 on April 24th
(Greenwich Mean Time), and to guarantee that United Nations
humanitarian aid would go unblocked and unhindered, otherwise NATO
would begin air strikes against the Serbian army.
