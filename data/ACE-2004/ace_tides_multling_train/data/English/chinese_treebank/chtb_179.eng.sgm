Xinhua News Agency, the UN, February 13th,

Today, Peilice Dekuliar, the UN Secretary-General, expressed grief at
the multi-national forces air striking Baghdad resulting in civilians
deaths.


Julileah, spokesman for the Secretary-General said in a statement
that Peilice Dekuliar felt deep grief that so many civilians in Iraq
had died in the air attack.


According to a news report on February 14th by Xinhua News Agency
from Beijing, when the multi-national forces carried out an air
attack on Baghdad on the 13th, hundreds of civilians were killed in
the bombing. World public opinion has reacted strongly to the event.


Officials in the Iraqi Department of Defense said that the two
missiles or bomb shells dropped by planes of the multi-national
forces on the 13th at 4 O'clock in the morning local time hit a large
sized underground bomb shelter and, at least 500 civilians hiding
inside were killed, more than half of whom were women and children.


The Tunisian government thinks that this bombing again shows that the
activity of the multi-national forces has exceeded authorized limits
set by the United Nations Security Council decision.

Tunisia has again appealed to international conscience to take
action, to stop the blood and end the destructive war, and create
conditions for a peaceful settlement of the conflict.

Ashitaer, the UN representative of Yemen strongly condemned this
incident and asked the United Nations Security Council to be
responsible for the passed resolution No. 678 which permits military
actions against Iraq.

He said that no one feels this "ferocious and inexcusable" bombing is
just.


In Amman, capital of Jordan, thousands of angry people paraded and
demonstrated in front of the US embassy, objecting to the
multi-national forces bombing and killing innocent civilians in
Baghdad.
