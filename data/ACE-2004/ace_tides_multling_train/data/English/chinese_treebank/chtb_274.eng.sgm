Dr. Xiaotong Fei, famous Chinese sociologist and vice chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, was awarded the
1994 Magasaysay "Community Leader" award here this afternoon.


The awarding ceremony was solemnly held at The Philippines Cultural
Center.

Filipino President Ramos chaired the awarding ceremony and gave out
the medal, prize money and certificate to the six outstanding people
awarded this year's Magasaysay award.


While delivering his appreciation speech, Xiaotong Fei said that "I
will never let down the encouragement given to me by this friendly
neighboring country. No matter how many years I still have allocated,
I will certainly conscientiously make use of every second to
diligently do good things to benefit Asian people, and even the
people of the world, so as to use the knowledge that mankind
accumulated to spur the present society to develop into a better
society."


The Ramon Magasaysay award, which was named after the former Filipino
president, is called the Asian Nobel prize.

There are five prizes in this award which are separately bestowed
each year on individuals and organizations making outstanding
contributions in the areas of government service, public service,
community leadership, media, literature and creative exchange art,
and also international understanding, etc.


Since it started being bestowed in 1958, 172 individuals and 14
organizations have already won this award.
