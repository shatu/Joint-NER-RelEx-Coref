than 14% for four years.

Currently, there are more than 10,000 foreign merchant investment
corporations in the entire city, and foreign capital of about 16
billion US dollars, among which US capital is ranked second.

corporations in Tianjin with total investment values of 2 billion US
dollars.

million US dollars in past years to 2 billion US dollars last year,
