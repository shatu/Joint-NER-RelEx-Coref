Mingquan Zhang, vice director of Shandong Province's Foreign Economy
and Trade Committee, said that in 1997, the quality and level of
Shandong's utilizing foreign capital had further improved.


Last year, although there was a drop in the quantity and the contract
amount of recently approved projects utilizing foreign capital in
Shandong Province, foreign capital actually utilized maintained
growth, reaching over 4.2 billion US dollars, and increasing more
than 17% compared with the previous year. Of this amount, foreign
merchants' investment actually realized was over 3 billion US
dollars, increasing 9% compared with the same period the previous
year.

In the whole year, recently approved enterprises to be invested by
foreign merchants neared 1600, and totally reached over 20,000.


The momentum of multinational companies investing in Shandong has not
decreased.

After such multi-national companies as Dupont, HP, Siemens,
Panasonic, Daewoo, etc. successively invested in Shandong, ten
multinational companies such as America's Chevron and Eton, France's
Elf, Shenggeban and the French Electric Company, Germany's Deutsch,
UK's Imperial Chemicals, etc. have come to invest in Shandong for the
first time.

By the end of last year, multinational companies coming to invest in
Shandong were over one hundred, among which 26 were ranked the top
100 in the world.

These multinational companies' investment projects are large in
scale, high in technology, and strong in their industrial promotion.


New breakthroughs were achieved in Shandong's methods of utilizing
foreign capital.

Since Qingdao Beer and Shandong Huaneng succeeded in respectively
issuing H-shares and N-shares in Hong Kong and the US, last year, 5
more share-holding companies, such as Shandong's Chenmin Paper
Manufacturing Group, Jinan's Qingqi Group, Yantai's Zhangyu Group,
Xinhua's Pharmacy Group and Lutai's Textile Group, etc. also entered
the market issuing foreign capital shares, totally attracting 265
million US dollars of foreign capital.

By the end of last year, seven enterprises in Shandong Province
issued H-shares, N-shares or B-shares, totally attracting over 700
million US dollars of foreign capital.


New progress has also been made in utilizing foreign capital for
infrastructure, foundation industries and new high level technology
projects.

In the area of energy, Shandong's China Power Generation Company,
Ltd. received the State's approval. With a total project investment
of nearly 2.3 billion US dollars and over 1 billion US dollars of
contracted foreign capital, it is currently Shandong Province's
largest project utilizing foreign capital.

In agriculture, the integrated agricultural development project
invested in by Australia's Southern Australia - Shandong
Stock-holding Company, Ltd. in the Yellow River delta region has a
total investment of nearly 30 million US dollars and over 10 million
US dollars of contracted foreign capital. It is currently Shandong's
largest integrated agricultural development project.

In the area of new high level technology, the investment projects of
world famous multinational companies such as the US's Eton, Germany's
Deutsch, the UK's Imperial Chemicals, etc. all have first-class
international levels of technology. These projects powerfully bring
about optimization and improvement of Shandong Province's industrial
structure.

In infrastructure, a number of expressway projects have been formally
signed with the outside, and a number of municipal public
infrastructure merchant-invitation projects have also been announced
overseas, signifying the complete start of utilizing foreign capital
in the areas of Shandong's infrastructure.


The economic development district has become a hotspot for attracting
foreign merchant investment.

Last year, Shandong's various types of economic development districts
recently approved over 1480 projects utilizing foreign capital,
accounting for more than 24% of the total of the entire province.

Over 900 million US dollars of foreign capital was actually utilized,
increasing nearly 40% compared with the same period the previous
year.

The total industrial output completed by enterprises within the
district for the year was over 47 billion US dollars, increasing by
nearly 80% compared with the previous year, and had nearly 1.7
billion US dollars of foreign export currency, increasing by 31%
compared with the same period the previous year.

As a new point of growth of Shandong's open economy, the economic
development district is showing development vitality that grows
stronger daily.


Last year, the total output of Shandong Province reached over 19.7
billion US dollars, increasing by over 10% compared with the previous
year.

Among this, exports broke through 13 billion US dollars, increasing
by 25% compared with the same period the previous year. Export values
ranked fourth in the nation, and the growth rate ranked second among
China's main coastal provinces and cities.
