and intern Zhehui Guan

The disabled student Hao Ding, who became an orphan in his childhood
and grew up in a children's welfare institution in Hangzhou, recently
received Hangzhou University's admission notice and became a student
of the Philosophy and Social Science Department of this school.

It is understood that Hao Ding, who is 19 years old this year, is the
first disabled, orphan college student adopted and brought up by a
welfare institution of New China.


"Receiving the admission notice, I really wanted to jump up", said
Hao Ding, but he could not "jump" to express his feelings of
excitement.

When he was three years old, a high fever caused him to suffer from
serious polio aftereffects, and that year he was adopted by a welfare
institution.


Hao Ding finished primary school at the children's welfare
institution, then he entered a school in a nearby township to go to
middle school.

At first, the children's welfare institution teachers took him and
picked him up, after the second year, he boarded, and every Saturday,
went back to the welfare institution, no matter whether it was windy
or rained, he never missed any classes.

This year he took part in the university entrance examination; and,
having an eligible score, he was admitted by Hangzhou University.


Hao Ding's success is the result of painstaking efforts of the people
from all social circles.

For 16 years the children's welfare institution has constantly taken
care of and loved him. Since last year, more than 3,000 yuan RMB has
been spent for him only for paying tuition, buying materials and
buying nutriments.

People from all circles of society have held out helping hands to
him.

After knowing that Hao Ding passed the university entrance
examination, the Longchang Grain and Oil Trade Company of Hangzhou
contributed 20,000 yuan to subsidize his going to university and
likewise, work units such as the Artificial Limbs Factory, etc. sent
him a wheelchair, a pair of walking sticks, etc.
