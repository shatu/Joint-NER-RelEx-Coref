industrial projects in Jiangxi provide a broad investment market for
foreign companies.

including transportation, energy, communication, mechanics,
electronics, etc., and foreign currency earned by foreign-invested
enterprises through exports is more than 1 billion US dollars.

operations. The Nanchang-Jiujiang highway, the Great Nanchang bridge,
etc. have all been put into use.

The program-controlled telephone and transmission systems of the
provincial capital, Nanchang, and other cities and areas are playing
a role.
