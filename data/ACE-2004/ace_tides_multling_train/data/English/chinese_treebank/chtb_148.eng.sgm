Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 9th

"China's 'Two Congresses' were held at a very important historical
moment. Congresses proliferate the basic theme of maintaining
stability, and causing our investment confidence in China to greatly
increase.

"The President of Siemens (China) Company, Ltd., Kehenen made the
above comment while recently receiving reporter interviews.


Since March, Mr. Kehenen has focused attention on the "Two
Congresses" with utmost passion. He gets the latest information on
the "Two Congresses" from papers and TV.


He said, prime minister Peng Li mentioned in the "Government Work
Report" that, priority must be on the development of infrastructure
and the economy of the Central and Western regions. This happens to
have the same view as Siemens' development strategies.


In the past year, Siemens invested 800 million US dollars to complete
Shanxi's YangCheng electric power plant project, provided equipment
and service to Shanghai's No. 2 subway line, participated in
Shanghai's No. 1 subway line and the construction of Guangzhou's
subway, provided electrical equipment to three steel factories in
Zhujiang, Handan, Baotou, and established offices in places such as
Wuhan, Chengdu, Kunming, etc.

This year, Siemens will diligently participate in China's
construction of the Three Gorges Project.


Kehenen said, whether a country has attractive power to foreign
investment lies on whether it has a stable political environment and
a healthy and complete legal system.

The National People's Congress meeting being held here has made
outstanding contributions to China's legal establishment.


It was learned that China occupies a very important status in
Siemens' Asian Pacific development strategy. According to plans, by
the year 2000, Siemens' total investment in China will exceed 1
billion US dollars, and sales amounts are planned to reach 7 billion
German Marks. This will be more than half of the total sale amount in
the Asia-Pacific region.

Then, the total number of employees in China will reach 80,000.


Currently, Germany's Siemens Company in China has a total of 34
joint-venture companies, three independent corporations and 14
offices.

In the rapidly developing Chinese electrical and electronic markets,
Siemens accounts for 65% of the share.
