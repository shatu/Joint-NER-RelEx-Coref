Ivory Coast's newly elected President Loran Gbagbo plans to announce
his government today. Mr. Gbagbo has ruled out new elections, but is
promising to set up what he calls a broad-based government of
national unity. In Washington State Department Spokesman, Phil
Reeker said new elections are necessary.

The election October 22nd was failed and fundamentally flawed from
the outset due to the exclusion of major party candidates and other
machinations leading up to the election. It's going to be very
important for the voices of the dissent franchise Ivorians to be
heard and in that sense the holding of free, fair and inclusive
elections will be needed to fully restore the government or put to
fore its legitimacy and bring democracy back to . 
<TURN>
Fresh violence broke out Thursday between the Gbagbo supporters and
backers of rival opposition leader Alassane Ouattara, who was barred
from Sunday's voting. At least 20 people were killed.
