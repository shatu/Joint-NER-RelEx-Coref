Palestinian officials have turned down a new peace proposal by
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Mr. Barak declared Thursday, he
is ready to recognize an independent Palestinian state, but added
that sensitive issues, such as control over Jerusalem, should be set
aside for up to three years. Palestinian leaders rejected the offer,
calling it an interim plan that fails to address their core
concerns, namely the fate of Jerusalem and the return of millions of
Palestinian refugees.
