all military and police to their barracks. The President is locked
in a power struggle with former intelligence service chief,
Vladimiro Monticenos. Mr. Fujimori told reporters late Wednesday, he
ordered a complete freeze on movements by the armed forces.
President Fujimori has been leading a purge of the military of those
loyal to Mr. Monticenos, the former spy master, whose surprise
