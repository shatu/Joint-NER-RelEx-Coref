A Venezuelan Ford execute says Firestone hid information about tyre
defects from Ford and should be held responsible for more than one
hundred traffic accidents in the South American country. Hector
Rodriguez told the hearing of the Venezuelan consumer protection
agency that Bridgeton Firestone knew about the tyre defects for many
months and should be held responsible for the accidents. In a letter
to the consumer panel a spokesman for Firestone said the company's
appearance at Wednesday's hearing would have implied fault, which it
denies. The Venezuelan government panel wants both Ford and
Firestone to compensate victims of accidents caused by Ford vehicles
equipped with Firestone tyres. Some 46 people have died on
Venezuelan highways in accidents caused by the vehicles.
