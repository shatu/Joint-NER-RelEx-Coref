I'm David Coler, VOA News. Three Florida courts are weighing cases
that could signally end in the month-long battle for the White
House. Decisions were expected swiftly with the December 12th
deadline for Florida to certify its 25 electors, the people who will
actually choose the next US President. Thursday, lawyers for Vice
President Al Gore and Texas Governor George W Bush were subjected to
intense grilling in a Florida Supreme Court hearing on the
Democratic candidate's appeal of the rejection of his request for a
recount. His chief lawyer David Boyz says whatever the court
decides, the state's deadline will be met.

I think that what they have consistently said is that they expect
this to be over by December 12th. We believe it can be over by
December 12th. And if they come out with an order that says we are
not going to count any ballots, that's going to resolve by December
12th. If they come out with an order that says we are going to count
the ballots, we're going to start now, we believe that can be
resolved by December 12th.

At the same time, the Bush legal team made its final arguments in a
challenge by Democratic voters who want thousands of absentee
ballots thrown out. If the challenge succeeds, it could more than
reverse the Texas Governor's 537-vote lead.
