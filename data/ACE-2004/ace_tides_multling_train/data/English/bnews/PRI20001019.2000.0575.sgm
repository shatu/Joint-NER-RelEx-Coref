In the other major story out of the Middle East ,Arab foreign
ministers met today in Cairo in advance of Saturday's Arab's summit.
Egypt called the emergency summit to declare support for the
Palestinians in the wake of three weeks of violence that has left at
least 106 people dead, almost all of them Palestinian. Violence has
abated somewhat since the deal was struck at Sharm el-Sheikh two
days ago, but Arab governments are under pressure from their own
citizens to take a tough stance against Israel. James Drummond,
discovering the Arab summit in Cairo for the Financial Times. James,
there's a reason why the Arab's wanted this pre-summit meeting. What
is the pressure on them prior to the summit? 
<TURN>
Well, I think they want to try and iron out any potential
difficulties before the heads of state come into town on Saturday
and Sunday. So this is a preparatory exercise to reach some sort of
agreement beforehand. 
<TURN>
Of course, the problem is that not all Arab states are speaking
again with one voice. What do they hope to achieve? And what can you
claim from the statements made today? 
<TURN>
It is difficult to say, Arab's summit are traditionally been
exercises in division. We have already seen problems from Libyan
leader Muammar Gaddafi on Tuesday who appeared on Al-Jazeera, the
Pan Arab Satellite Channel, and he, rubbish, what he said was a
draft statement for the end of the summit on Sunday. And he was very
categorical that it was two weak and did not harm Israeli interests
sufficiently. 
<TURN>
So we have Gadafi on the one hand. On the other hand we have Egypt
which was the first Arab country to make peace with the Jewish
state, which is of course also a top recipient of US aid. The
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is more of a voice of moderation
against the other side. Tell us about what he has been saying. 
<TURN>
Well, Mr. Mubarak has been, as you say, a voice of moderation. He
has invested an awful amount in the peace with Israel, and really he
cannot afford to let it fail. We have seen some more power
techniques perhaps from his foreign minister Amre Moussa over the
last few weeks, but Amre Moussa today at the foreign minister's
meeting was calling simply for the return of East Jerusalem to the
Palestinians, in stark contrast to Syrian foreign minister Faruq
al-Shara who was pulling for a complete cut in diplomatic relations
between Israel and the two Arab states that happen. So Egypt is
playing a calming role, it will not want to see anything too strong
coming out of this summit due to end on Sunday. 
<TURN>
What seemed to be the prevailing voices at this point? There are
certainly calls for war against Israel. Is there much support for
that? 
<TURN>
Well, actually President Mubarak was very categorical today in
condemning calls for war, which he said were very serious and people
should understand the implications of just what it meant. Egypt and
Jordan do not want to see any sort of conventional war against
Israel. They have both invested enormous amounts in it, and both
regimes would be more vulnerable if the peace process were to fail,
because detractors and opponents within each country would have
ammunition by which to fire at them. 
<TURN>
How much is the United States entering into the conversation and how
much pressure seems to be coming from the United States? 
<TURN>
Well today not too much. I mean Madeleine Albright was in Saudi
Arabia yesterday where she met with crown prince Abdullah and the
new Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad. Interestingly enough she is
quoted as telling General Sanholi back to the US that she did not
really get too much of a reception from Bashar Al-Assad in terms of
lightening the traditionally antagonistic Syrian align towards
Israel. Nonetheless, the fact that she did meet with Bashar Al-Assad
and it wasn't Saudi Arabia which is traditionally being more dovish
and has supported US policy, it is significant. So, as of today, I
would say certainly on the surface there has been little US action. 
<TURN>
Well, thank you very much for the update. James Drummond,
correspondent for the financial times of London speaking to us from
Cairo. Thank you James. 
<TURN>
Thanks.
