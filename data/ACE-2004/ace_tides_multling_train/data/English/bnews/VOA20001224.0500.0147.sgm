Palestinian and Israeli negotiators are headed home with some ideas
put forward by President Clinton after failing to reach a
breakthrough in their talks with US officials in Washington. The
negotiators are expected to report back by Wednesday after
discussing the ideas with top officials. After a meeting at the
White House Saturday, none of those involved in the talks would give
details about Mr. Clinton's ideas on how to break this stalemate and
proceed toward a peace settlement. After the meeting Israeli Foreign
Minister, Shlomo Ben-Ami would only say that formidable obstacles
remain. 
<TURN>
It's still too early to confirm, that is we need to deliberate
between ourselves on whether we see these ideas that were raised
here, as a basis for an end game. 
<TURN>
Chief Palestinian negotiator Sayeeb Erekat told reporters that
serious differences continue concerning Jerusalem, refugee, security
and territorial issues. 
<TURN>
Major gaps still exist. This morning we've heard ideas from
President Clinton. We will convey to President Arafat and then we'll
take it from there as to what will be the next step. 
<TURN>
Mr. Clinton is working hard for a peace deal before he leaves office
next month. There are reports that he could meet separately with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, then decide if there was reason for a three way Summit, but
the White House is calling talks of such a Summit premature.
