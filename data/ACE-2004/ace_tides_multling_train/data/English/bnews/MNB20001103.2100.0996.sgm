it will be one of the first election returns on tuesday. it will
also be among the most important. as we continue our coverage of
presidential politics with a look at the last-minute battle to win a
crucial swing state, florida. 25 electoral votes. it's being fought
over hard wsm a look at how the candidates are getting out the vote
there, here's nbc news correspondent kerry sanders. 
<TURN>
the image of florida, both fact and fiction. a great getaway, a
state where a mouse wields more power than the a tropical paradise.
while the mild winters make this comfortable living for almost three
million seniors, the largest elderly population in the united
states, this year it is not the weather drawing al gore and george
w. bush to the sunshine state. both candidates list 25 reasons to
keep coming back, florida's 25 electoral votes. polls show florida
is still up for grabs. 
<TURN>
both candidates have been here almost equally. in fact, it's almost
i dare you politics. each of them dares the other one to spend less
time, money, and energy than they are at their own peril. 
<TURN>
elderly voters once again in florida, the most important voting bloc
because they actually vote more than any other group. in this
election, 45% of those going to the voting booth are expected to be
over the age of 65. the issue most important to them, social
security. 
<TURN>
pay down the nation's debt, strengthen social security, cut taxes
for middle class family, save our environment. experience. vision.
values. al gore. 
<TURN>
why does al gore say one thing when the truth is another? his
attacks on george bush's social security plan, exaggerations. the
truth, nonpartisan analysis confirms george bush's plan sets aside
$2.4 trillion to strengthen social security. 
<TURN>
both candidates repeatedly talking about that one issue. but in
florida where there are more than 550 children born every day,
families drive the other campaign issues. polls show education, the
environment, and the candidate's character will influence who voters
choose. and in this diverse state with a 15% hispanic population,
both candidates courting their votes in ways not seen in any
previous election. following both conventions, gore and bush granted
their first live tv interviews to this man. 
<ANNOTATION> speak spanish </ANNOTATION>
his name, jorge ramos, the tom brokaw of spanish language news. 
<TURN>
the race gets really, really close. and let's suppose that states
like florida and illinois might decide the election lest maybe,
maybe hispanic votes might decide, too, who would be the next
president of the united states. the largest hispanic voting bloc of
florida, republican voter who is do not seem to be crossing the
party line. gore wanted the young cuban boy, eli a n gonzalez to
stay in this country. joe lieberman brings gore's support he
probably would have gotten here anyway. sizable jewish and
african-american voting blocs. of the 10 largest states, florida is
the most republican. the republican governor here, jeb bush was once
expected to deliver his brother this state. the managers of both
campaigns saying in the end, the wipper may simply be determined by
who gets more people to the voting booth. kerry sanders, nbc news,
