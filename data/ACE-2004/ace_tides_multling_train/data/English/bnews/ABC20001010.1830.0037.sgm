-- has in the world, one in the middle east is all too obvious, and
as of is in broadcast tonight, the clinton administration is not
making much progress getting palestinians and israelis to lay off
each other and talk about it. the other is north korea. today, after
a year working the problem, the clinton administration and the
highest ranking official from there that's ever been here have had
discussions, described to us as direct, and positive and warm. we'll
get to korea in a minute. there is no substantial change for the
better in the middle east tonight. israelis and palestinians still
having the series of running battles to confirm each other's worst,
even stereotype view of the other. abc's gillian finley begins in
palestinian gaza. 
<TURN>
in gaza today, israeli soldiers opened fire on school boys, throwing
stones. a 12-year-old is in critical condition. in ramallah, troops
battled older students in what has become a daily event here. but
for the first time today, israel's military said the level of
violence was significantly lower. and prime minister barak held open
the possibility that the harsh action he has been threatening may
not be needed. if there is a beginning of change, he said, we will
take that into consideration. 
<TURN>
i think it helps. i think we need relative calm to work out these
things. 
<TURN>
relative calm may have come to the palestinian territories, but in
israel itself, tension is growing. particularly at night. in many
cities, angry crowds roam the streets. jews and palestinians looking
for confrontation. last night in tel aviv, jews attacked a
restaurant and employs palestinians. "we want war," the crowd
chanted. today, one newspaper headline warned of civil war. israelis
have so often felt insulated from this kind of violence. the last 13
days have changed all of that. gillian findlay, abc news, jerusalem.
