like many heartland states, iowa has had trouble keeping young
people down on the farm or anywhere within state lines. with
population waning, the state is looking beyond its borders for
newcomers. as abc's jim sciutto reports, one little town may provide
a big lesson. 
<TURN>
on homecoming night postville feels like hometown, usa, but a look
around this town of 2,000 shows it's become a miniature ellis
island. 
<TURN>
this was an all-white, all-christian community that all the sudden
was taken over -- not taken over, that's a very bad choice of words,
but invaded by, perhaps different groups. 
<TURN>
it began when a hasidic jewish family bought one of the town's two
meat-packing plants 13 years ago. first they brought in other
hasidic jews, then mexicans, palestinians, ukrainians. the plant and
another next store changed the face of postville. 
<TURN>
i think postville might be catching up with the rest of america. if
you look all over america, if you did a study of any great city, you
would see the same thing. 
<TURN>
the plants helped spur economic development in a town that had long
been stagnant. stores are expanding. new apartments and houses are
being built. and there are hundreds of new jobs, making unemployment
almost nonexistent. 
<TURN>
what else would you like? 
<TURN>
postville now has 22 different nationalities, but some resident
haven't welcomed the newcomers. 
<TURN>
they have no insurance on their cars. they don't stop at stop signs.
they do not put their children in a cash -- they're never heard of a
car seat. 
<TURN>
you know we've been here a long time and i think most people would
meet them halfway, but that doesn't seem to be what they want. 
<TURN>
for those who prefer the old postville, mayor john hyman has a
simple answer. 
<TURN>
i just tell them, you've got to change. they're here to stay.
they're not gonna leave. and you're going to have to adapt to these
people. 
<TURN>
iowa's governor is now looking to follow postville's example,
relaxing immigration quoteios. it's a goal that seems possible when
on homecoming night the starting kicker is 14-year-old nikita
kargalskiy, who may be 5,000 miles from his hometown in russia. jim
sciutto, abc news, postville iowa.
