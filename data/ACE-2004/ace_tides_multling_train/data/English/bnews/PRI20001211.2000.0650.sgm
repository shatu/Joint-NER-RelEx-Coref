And so the Supreme Court is about to decide a case that will
probably determine who becomes the next President. If this strikes
you as an extraordinary turn of events, well it strikes many
overseas as nearly unbelievable. In the democracies of Europe, legal
experts are saying it can't happen here. Philippe Shatiney is an
editor of the French news weekly, Mahiyan. Philippe, could it happen
anywhere else. 
<TURN>
Oh, I really think not. First of all, because there are so few
countries which are organized on the American model with it's, the
powers of the state. So yes I think there is a lot of bemusement
here in Europe about the difficulties that the Americans are having
in choosing a president. I think there is also a lot of amusement
though, there is a lot of finger pointing. It's always funny for the
small guys to laugh when the giant trips over his feet. 
<TURN>
Well, lets look at the United States Supreme Court itself and our
justice system, now is there an institution that is independent of
politics that serves anything like the function that the US Supreme
Court serves? 
<TURN>
Well, yes mostly European judicial systems do have a form of the
Supreme Court. However, for example, in France the strict machinery
of justice is separated from the constitutional court, which is a
separate body, but yes there also the members are appointed by the
President and therefore there also, the members of the Coseque
constitutionalle are somewhat open to criticism that the decisions
are often more motivated by politics than they are by the law.
However, I think that the image that we Europeans had, of the
American system and especially of the US Supreme Court, was that
those justices were above politics and, I think, that is also one of
the bad surprises that this election is reserving to us Europeans is
that finally your system is not as perfect as we were led to
believe. 
<TURN>
I wonder in terms of this particular case, now this is certainly an
extreme case in the United States with an unfathomably close
election. How have other Democracies dealt with effective ties, I
mean could there for instance be one of elections, you know where
our type has gone to the courts. What happens to yours? 
<TURN>
Well, there have been cases in most recent elections in France where
the Coseque constitutionalle having been apprised of doubtful
procedures or doubtful ways of counting the votes, have decided
either to null the election and have it done over again or to in
fact change the winner. However, our electoral system is so much
more simple in the sense that we have seperate elections for the
Presidency, for Parliament, for our Mayors and therefore usually
most French voters are faced with the difficulty of choosing a
little paper ballotenne with a name on it and putting that in an
envelop and then put that in the urn, so there is a much less chance
of error, at least, in our French system. 
<TURN>
Hey, it is interesting there also, when we look at the idea of
checks and balances in a non-partisan judiciary, in terms of the
checks and balances, that actually originated in France. 
<TURN>
Yes indeed, it was a political idea put forward in the writings of
the and another very famous french political observer Alexis de
Tocqueville who visited America and wrote an amazingly good book
about American democracy, said exactly that, that America seemed to
him to be the single country in the world who has managed to apply
the separation of powers between the judiciary, the executive, and
the legislative in a better way than any other country. So it's
quite surprising for us Europeans to see that the Supreme Court
would be involved, not really it seems to us in interpreting the law
of the land or the constitution of the United States, but more in
deciding the merits of a terribly political case.
