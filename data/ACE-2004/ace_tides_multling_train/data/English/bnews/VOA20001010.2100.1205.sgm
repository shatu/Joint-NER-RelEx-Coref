One other Major League baseball manager is now looking for a new
team to lead. The Toronto Blue Jay's have decided not to renew the
contract of Jim Firgossy after the team placed third in the American
League Eastern division for two straight seasons. Toronto finished
with the mediocre 83 and 79 record and Firgossy's contract expired
at the end of the season. Before the Blue Jay's announcement Tuesday
Firgossy said that he felt that he would not be asked to return.
General Manager Gord Ash says he felt the team needed a different
manager to become a playoff contender.

I think our club over the last two years made some progress, but
it's a time now to get to the next level and my intuition along with
those of us in our baseball cabinet. We do make these decisions in a
organizational faction and the organization felt that we would be
best served by making a change.

Firgossy is the sixth manager to be fired since the season ended. He
says he is not interested in another position with the Toronto
organization, but he would like to remain in baseball.
