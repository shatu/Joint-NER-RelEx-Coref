now "the truth squad," a reality check on the candidates. in all our
polling, americans have rated education as the number one issue in
this election. this year, the federal government is spending nearly
$123 billion on education. that's $60 billion more than ten years
ago. that's still a small fraction of the total spent. nonetheless,
many of the other schools are in trouble. so what would gore and
bush do to fix them? are their plans realistic? nbc's lisa myers and
"the truth squad" with some answers tonight, "in depth."

george bush on the problem of education in this country -- 
<TURN>
america today is in the midst of an education recession that can
threaten our very future. 
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
a recession? experts say that term's an exaggeration. it's true that
the gap in test scores between white and minority students has
grown. but experts say overall student performance has not declined. 
<TURN>
to say there's been a recession implies that scores are going down.
and there aren't any test scores going down. 
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
at worst, they've been flat. 
<TURN>
at worst, they've been flat. 
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
both candidates have a laundry list of proposals to improve
education. at the top of gore's -- a tax break to help families pay
for college. 
<TURN>
i want to give new choices to parents to send their kids to college
with a $10,000 tax deduction for college tuition, per child, per
year. 
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
experts say this is less generous than it sounds. first, gore's
deduction is limited to $10,000 per family, not per child, as he
said. what's more, his plan merely would modestly expand an existing
tuition credit. the bottom line for your family? 
<TURN>
the most that this credit could give any family is $800 more than
what they get under present law. 
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
another key issue this year -- how to deal with failing public
schools. one of bush's solutions -- double the number of
independent, publicly funded schools, known as charter schools. 
<TURN>
we encourage parents to take a look at the comparative results of
schools. we've got a strong charter school movement that i signed
the legislation to get started in the state of texas. 
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
but experts say the early record of charter schools in texas is not
as strong as bush claims. some schools, like houston's kipp academy,
are said to be doing a great job with economically disadvantaged
students. but a report finds that charter schools overall in texas
have more students per teacher, less experienced teachers and lower
test scores. 
<TURN>
it's a mixed picture. charter schools are having some successes and
some struggles. but overall, students in charter schools have lower
performance scores than students in traditional public schools. 
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
so how would gore deal with failing public schools? 
<TURN>
if it's a failing school, shut it down, and reopen it under a new
principal, with a turnaround team of specialists the way governor
jim hunt does in north carolina. 
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
but governor hunt's office says no school has been shut down yet in
his state. so experts say it's too soon to tell if it works. and
some call gore's plan an empty promise. why? because they say gore
does not require the kind of annual student testing needed to tell
whether a school is failing or not. 
<TURN>
there's simply not as much there as vice president gore is
pretending that there is. it's really more rhetoric than substance. 
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
most misleading of all, experts say, is each candidate's claim that
his plan can dramatically improve public education. because federal
money accounts for only 7% of school funding, experts say any
president can help only at the margins. lisa myers, nbc news,
