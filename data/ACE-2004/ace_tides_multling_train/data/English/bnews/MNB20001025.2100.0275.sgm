for a late update, live from the campaign trail we're joined by nbc
news correspondent campbell brown ho who's traveling with the bush
effort. and nbc news correspondent chip reid travel traveling with
the gore campaign in kansas city missouri. good evening to you. 
<TURN>
good evening, brian. well, bush ended the day with a big rally here.
we're just outside of tampa. and i'll tell you, these evening
rallies really have the feel of a rock concert, or maybe a pro
wrestling match. you have strobe lights. you have screaming crowds.
all designed to make bush look like a winner. but he is not a winner
yet in florida. there is one new poll out that actually puts gore
ahead here. there are still several polls that say bush is still
ahead in florida. bottom line, as we heard david gregory report,
this is not the position the campaign wanted to be in at this stage
of the game. bush's central message on this bu bus trip across
central florida today was to his die hard sup portes telling them go
out, tell your friends still on the fence why they need to vote for
me. and it's a message the campaign hopes it was able to convey
today. because while florida is a must win, they also cannot ignore
the other battleground states. brian tomorrow morning, bush flies to
pennsylvania, another swing state with 2023 electoral votes. just
two less than florida. pennsylvania traditionally, a democratic
state, but one where there's a popular republican governor, tom
ridge, and there's a lot of pressure on ridge right now to deliver
pennsylvania. he'll end up tomorrow night in ohio, and then end the
week in another two crucial states, wisconsin and michigan. 
<TURN>
thank you for that.
