at $141 million, mostly private doe flagss, the monument will
feature pillars that form an open circle. gold stars will
commemorate the 400,000 americans killed in the war. but these days,
nothing in washington comes easy. the planning alone for this
memorial has lasted longer than it took to win world war ii. and
now, the monument itself is caught up in controversy. not whether to
build it, but where.

public protests, even lawsuits.

those who fought and won world war ii. jim miklaszewski, nbc news,,
