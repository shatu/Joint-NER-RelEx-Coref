In Major League Baseball, the Cincinnati Reds have hired Bob Boon as
their new manager, after two other candidates turned down their
650,000-dollar contract offer. Boon managed the Kansas City Royals
between 1995 and 1997. He became the leading candidate after New
York Yankees third base coach Willy Randoff and Reds third base
coach Ron Oster refused Cincinnati's offer. He replaces Jack McCaine
who was fired after the Reds failed to make the post season despite
adding slugger Ken Greffy Junior to their lineup. Boon said Friday
he believes the Reds can compete with any team in their division. 
<TURN>
We are not going to be able to compete with several teams in our
division from a financial standpoint, but I really believe we can
compete with them on the field and that's where it all comes down to
and I'm just excited to get going. I wish spring training started
tomorrow. 
<TURN>
The Reds were the second of six Major League teams to fire their
managers, but they were the last to fill the vacancy because of
their contract offer.
