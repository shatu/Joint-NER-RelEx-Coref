The political maneuvering going on in Israel could put us to shame.
The Israeli Parliament is considering moves that could allow former
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to run against incumbent Ehud
Barak. Lets backup for a minute. Barak announced 2 weeks ago that he
would call for early elections. Then yesterday he resigned,
triggering the vote in about 2 months. And guess who under current
Israeli law would be ineligible to run for Prime Minister? That's
right, the former front runner Benjamin Netanyahu. You see,
Netanyahu gave up his parliamentary seat last year after his
election lost to Barak and in Israel, if you are not in the
Parliament, you can't run for Prime Minister. The World's Richard
Myron explains. 
<TURN>
Against the backdrop of continuing violence in the West Bank and
Gaza strip , election campaign has begun here. Yesterday Ehud Barak
won the endorsement of his Labor party as it's candidate for Prime
Minister and while his supporters may be cheering, many other
Israelis have turned away from the man they elected just 18 months
ago. Opinion polls show him neck and neck with the current leader of
the right wing Likud party, Ariel Sharon. But Barak trails former
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by 16 points according to one
poll. Among Labor party activists such as legislator Yael Dayan
there is a sense of confusion about Barak's unpopularity. 
<TURN>
It certainly objectively doesn't make any sense. It means we have to
try harder and to remind people why they said such a big no to
Netanyahu only a year and a half ago. Barak can win and if he comes
to the elections with an indication of continuation of the peace,
he's got a majority. 
<TURN>
The discredited former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu now faces a
number of legal obstacles before he can challenge Barak for the top
job. According to current legislation only a member of parliament
can stand for the position of Prime Minister. Netanyahu supporters
are calling either for a change in the law or for simultaneous
elections for the Knesset and Prime Minister, which would allow
their candidate to run. Senior Likud activists like Yosee Ahmed say
that Barak's decision to call an election just for Prime Minister
won't save him from his opponent in the country or in the Knesset. 
<TURN>
Barak didn't just do someone thing which is very cynical, he also
did something which is not very clever politically because there is
a majority, built-in majority in the Knesset against him and if
there are elections only for Prime Minister, even if he is elected
again, how can he manage the country with the built-in majority
against him. So, I would therefore call his act an act of extreme
irresponsibility. 
<TURN>
As the political tempo quickens in Israel, so the violence continues
in the West Bank and Gaza. In Bethlehem Palestinians buried another
victim of the current troubles killed in fighting yesterday with the
Israeli army, but as the casualties on both sides continue to mount,
there are also rumors of high level secret contacts between the
Israelis and the Palestinians to find a political solution to the
conflict. Gushin Baskin, co-director of the Israel-Palestine Center
for Research and Information says that the prospects of an election
in Israel could improve the chances for peace. 
<TURN>
Barak's standing in the polls is so bad that the only thing that can
save his political career now is a peace deal, which is the only
reason to be optimistic that something might actually happen. It's
that personal self motivation of Barak's desire to survive
politically and to have some kind of future in this country knowing
that if he goes to elections with a peace agreement, any kind of
peace agreement, he stands much better chance of being elected than
going to the electorate with nothing. 
<TURN>
Amid the political intrigue in Israel an international commission
led by former US senator, George Mitchell today began investigating
the causes of the unrest here. Mitchell said he hoped his work would
reduce the level of violence, but his task is going to be difficult
amid the mutual accusations and the rising death toll. For The World
this is Richard Myron in Jerusalem.
