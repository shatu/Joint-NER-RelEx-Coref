Traditional international broadcasters like Radio Prague and Radio
Slovakia International are now facing competition from a private
Internet venture called the European Internet Network or EIN. The
Prague-based EIN presently operates country-specific portals with
news and information about Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, China,
Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Macedonia, Poland, Romania,
Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Yugoslavia. Portals will be added in
2001 for Germany, France, Italy, and Spain. These English language
web pages contain mainly text, including material from the Reuters
News Agency plus some pictures. The URL is www.europeaninternet.com.
