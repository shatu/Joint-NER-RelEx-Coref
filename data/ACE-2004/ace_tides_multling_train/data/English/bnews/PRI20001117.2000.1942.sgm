In a historic speech, President Clinton has addressed the people of
Vietnam, urging them to work with Americans to heal the wounds of
war. The President also spoke of the staggering sacrifice of the 3
million Vietnamese soldiers and civilians who died during the
conflict. 
<TURN>
Let us continue to help each other heal the wounds of war, not by
forgetting the bravery shown and the tragedy suffered by all sides,
but by embracing the spirit of reconciliation and the courage to
build better tomorrows for our children. 
<TURN>
President Clinton also raised the issue of human rights but went on
to stress the US was not trying to impose its own ideals. You have
already shown the world he said that Vietnam takes it's own
decisions
