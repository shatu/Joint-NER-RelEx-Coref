once again there'll be two presidential candidates missing form the
debate. pat buchanan hardly registers on the political radar this
year. and ralph nader, who may make the difference between a gore or
bush win in several places. abc's linda douglas was with his
campaign over the weekend. 
<TURN>
ralph nader says his campaign is starting to take off. do you feel
momentum from last night? 
<TURN>
yeah. well, it was pretty big. 7777 
<TURN>
at a nader rally in madison square garden, 15,000 people joined
actors tim robbins, susan sarandon and other stars to hear his
message -- that average americans are powerless. 
<TURN>
they have lost control of their government. they have lost control
of their workplace. 
<TURN>
nader condemns corporations, drug companies, pesticide
manufacturers, banks, landlords, the media. his supporters say they
don't care that he has no chance to become president. 
<TURN>
i want to see my vote as a statement that i will no longer
compromise. 
<TURN>
nader says george bush and al gore are essentially corrupt. 
<TURN>
here's the difference between bush and gore when it comes to
corporate power. it's velocity with which their knees hit the floor
when corporations knock on their doors. applause 
<TURN>
in a year when most candidates are afraid of appearing negative,
ralph nader attacks his rivals with gusto. 
<TURN>
george w. bush is really a big corporation running for president
disguised as a human being. 
<TURN>
butader is most critical of al gore, often when speaking to
democrats. 
<TURN>
he has betrayed, he has lied, he has deceived, he has dissembled. 
<TURN>
democrats fear nader may make a differee in some key states, like
washington and wisconsin, luring voters away from gore and handing
the election to bush. you know, some of the democrats are going to
blame you if gore loses. 
<TURN>
they ought to blame themselves. 
<TURN>
who do you think is going to win this year? 
<TURN>
i don't know. it's very close. 
<TURN>
do you care? 
<TURN>
no. 
<TURN>
he says this year's campaign is really abt the next election, about
building a serious third party and qualifying for federal campaign
money. 
<TURN>
thanks for running. 
<TURN>
thanks for voting. 
<TURN>
nader is never happier than when he is taking on the system. linda
