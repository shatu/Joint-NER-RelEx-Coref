Afghanistan's Taliban faction and the opposition Northern Alliance
have agreed to peace talks sponsored by the United Nations. The UN
special envoy for Afghanistan Franchesco Bendrel says the world body
has received separate letters from the two sides, pledging to
participate in the negotiations with serious intent and to not
abandon the process unilaterally. Mr. Bendrel says he hopes to begin
the talks next week, probably by shuttling between the two
delegations at first. If the talks go well, they would then move to
indirect talks in the same city and finally face-to-face
negotiations.
