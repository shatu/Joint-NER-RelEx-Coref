GOP vice presidential nominee Dick Cheney celebrated thanksgiving in
a Washington D.C. Hospital where he is recovering from what doctors
said was a mild heart attack. Cheney got a telephone call from his
democratic counter part Joseph Lieberman wishing him a speedy
recovery. The hospital spokeswoman said that Cheney could go home as
early as tomorrow if his recovery continues to go well. I am Corey
