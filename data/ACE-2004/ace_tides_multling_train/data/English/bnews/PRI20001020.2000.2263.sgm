The results of a news survey show the support for South African
President Thabo Mbeki is dropping. The Institute for Democracy in
South Africa, which conducted the survey, found that only half of
all South Africans approve of the way their President has handled
his job. Embeke has been widely criticized for questioning the
causal link between HIV and AIDS in the face of a pandemic, which
threatens to decimate South Africa. Last week the government
announced that the South African President will be withdrawing from
the public debate about AIDS. The Worlds Carolyn Demster reports
from Johannesburg on the saga, which has tainted Embeke's image. 
<TURN>
President Embeke's personal interest in HIV and AIDS began during a
late night session surfing the Internet. He located the views of
dissident scientists who dispute the causal link between HIV and
AIDS, solicited their opinions and then invited them to participate
in a Presidential Advisory Panel of Aids experts. South African
scientists were the first to question the President's meddling in a
scientific debate, which they contended, was already over. They were
pressured into silence. A declaration of the world's foremost 5000
Aids researchers and scientists, stating unequivocally that HIV
leads to AIDS was contemptuously dismissed as fit only for the
dustbin by the President's spokesman. And then in a bid to clarify
his stance, President Embeke addressed Parliament on the matter. 
<TURN>
The program of the government in this country is based on the thesis
that HIV causes AIDS. 
<TURN>
But Embeke didn't stop there. 
<TURN>
AIDS is Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. It's a sensible thing
to ask -Does one virus cause a syndrome? A virus cannot cause a
syndrome. And AIDS is a syndrome. 
<TURN>
It might be a case of peer semantics but the President has
resolutely refused to say clearly that HIV causes AIDS. He has
accused his critics of racism when they point to unsafe sexual
practices and the high incidents of rape in South Africa to explain
why an estimated 1700 more people are infected with the HI virus
everyday. The ensuing public debate has left South Africans, many of
them uneducated and illiterate, confused and helpless. Here at
Berthwana hospital's anti-natal clinic on the outskirts of Suheto
the extent of the problem is frightening. This is Africa's largest
hospital and daily the wards fill with patients with AIDS related
illnesses. In the anti-natal clinic slightly less than a third of
pregnant women test positive for the HI virus. Their only hope for
their unborn children is to sign up for a trial research program.
This means they will be treated free of charge with anti retra-viral
drugs, which, have been proven in clinical trials elsewhere in
Africa to dramatically reduce the risk of mother to child
transmission. But to date the South African government has refused
to provide the drugs at state hospitals arguing that they are too
expensive. Florencen Gubeni is a counselor at the HIV AIDS
Peri-natal Research Unit. She is HIV positive and also lost her
child to AIDS. And she is angry with President Embeke. 
<TURN>
The one man that we believe that he can make a difference by saying
something positive and being , he's the one person who doesn't
understand whether HIV does cause AIDS. So of course though we
follow him, he's the President, he's the man, he's black, you know.
And HIV in reality is affecting a lot of black men and they will
take his statement. And that's what we see that men are starting to
say, 'We are men. We don't have HIV. Even our President says so. Why
should we use condoms? You women are the ones who have HIV. Do it,
it's your own will.' 
<TURN>
Florencen Gubeni also says the President's attitude has made her job
as an AIDS educator doubly difficult, especially persuading men to
wear condoms. 
<TURN>
I really appreciate for him to admit personally that he has made a
mistake. He has said something that has caused a lot of confusion. 
<TURN>
But President Embeke isn't backing down. He is reported to have said
that the US Central Intelligence Agency was conspiring to promote
the thesis that HIV causes AIDS, this in order to boost the profits
of major pharmaceutical companies which manufacture anti retra-viral
drugs. He also alleged that this is part of a wider plot to
undermine both him as well as South Africa's attempts to obtain a
more equitable world economic order. Conspiracy theories aside, the
reality is that hundreds of thousands of South Africans are
suffering and dying needlessly in vivid contrast to developing
nations like Uganda, Thailand and Brazil where the governments have
adopted a pro-active role in manufacturing low-cost anti retra-viral
drugs and are running highly successful AIDS education and condom
campaigns. For The World I'm Carolyn Demster in Johannesburg.
