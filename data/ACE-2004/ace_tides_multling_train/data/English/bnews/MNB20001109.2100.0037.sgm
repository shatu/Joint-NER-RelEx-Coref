and good evening to you. there is still no clear winner in the
election that was now two nights ago. a under way in florida, and it
may not end there. here is the status of the recount as of this
hour. the two candidates separated by only 225 votes, with 65 out of
67 counties reporting. it has narrowed dramatically all day long.
today the gore campaign seemed to say the case belongs in florida
state courts. the bush campaign chided right back that the other
side wants to keep voting until they like the and increasingly
across the nation you can hear it and feel it. the split now
palpable. there's and among partisan, anger. americans remain glued
to their television sets. but no answer is coming out and even cuba
remarked tonight in an official statement that it sure is taking
america a long time to pake pick a. odd pairings tonight at the
white house when all the nation's living p presidents except reagan
were together at the white house celebrating the 200th anniversary
of the grand house. there was george w. bush's dad alongside the
president tonight for a photo op. we have correspondents tonight. 
<TURN>
first to the florida capital and legal correspondent dan abrams in
tallahassee. 
<TURN>
brian. this was supposed to be the day when we were going to have a
final decision, we were going to know what is the result of the
recount in florida. not to be the case. the official results showing
only 53 of the 67 counties have issued their recount results and
provided them to the state government here. on the other hand, as
you reported just a moment ago, the associated press reporting that
65 of the 67 counties have reported. the problem is the numbers are
so very different. on the one hand you have the associated press
saying 225-vote difference after 65 counties. you have the officials
here saying after 53 counties, exactly the same number difference
that it was when the recount began. 1,784. and if you watch the way
these numbers have been coming in, the associated press numbers have
constantly made it closer and closer, gore gaining ground on bush
with almost every county's result. on the other hand, the official
numbers that have been coming in keep seesawing. bush gets a few
more, gore gets a few more and we're gack back to even again,
according to state officials. 
<TURN>
so when we get the two wre maining counties will that be the best
number going? 
<TURN>
i don't know if to be the best number. i just can't believe these
numbers are going to end up matching at the end. msnbc because as
a.p. has continued with its numbers the progression has been
consistent. every time they gave you a set of count ids counties
that have been vaulted evaluated, gore was getting closer and
closer. on the other hand, with every group of counties reporting
officially it remained about even. so in the end, brian, i think
official the official numbers will be the numbers that apply but
we'll have to wait and see when all 67 are counted by both. 
<TURN>
thank you for that. and there are still several thousand absentee
votes.
