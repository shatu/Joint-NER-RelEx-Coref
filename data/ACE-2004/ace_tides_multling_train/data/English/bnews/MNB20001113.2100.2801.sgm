and we continue tonight to try to measure just how this story is
playing overseas as we'll be doing each night all week. tonight, the
anchor of the israeli network evening newscast on channel 2
jerusalem jacob elon on what israelis are thinking and saying about
america's long wait for a president elect. 
<TURN>
frankly, we are shocked here. we are used to the israeli political
system, always tied and always tied up. and election nights here too
close to call more often than not. but what you're experiencing over
there is really inconceivable to israelis. they spend a lot of air
time here trying to convey the electoral system to my viewers here.
and the election action i got was basically hey, this is
undemocratic. this is the greatest democracy we're talking about.
and the system is undemocratic. and the turnout as well i felt's
over 90% here usually. and it's hard for israeli citizens to grasp
50%. since we're talking about israeli reel and the middle east,
it's not, you know, the major headline every day, but it certainly
was a major story. on the election day, we had hours and hours of
broadcast here live, same as in the states. and we've been following
this story, of course, every day. but here as usual, i might say, we
have news of our own. actually today, we just had four israelis
killed in three serate terrorist acts. the peace forces don't like
uncertainty. i would say even less than the stock market. and things
here are getting worse day by day. israel is usually looking up to
the president of the united states for some help. some israelis at
least, if not most of them, are still hoping that president clinton
might be able to intervene and help in the short time he has left.
but the more things are complicated and uncertain back there in the
states, i think more and more israelis are worried that there's
nobody to turn toment -- to. and i think what happened in the past
few days among israelis here is a new perception that maybe things
in the united states are not as perfect as they might have thought.
actually, they're far from being perfect, and they are sounding and
looking to us here more and more like what we know from our own
political system.

that insight tonight from jay sob eilon, the anchorman israel's
channel 2 network news. he took time out from covering the death of
lea rabin, widow of yitzhak rabin. she died yesterday of cancer at
the age of 72.
