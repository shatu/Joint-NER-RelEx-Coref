even with all the growth in online shopping in the past few years,
this christmas could be the last one for many dotcom retailers. with
our ongoing inside look at etoys, one of the symbols of the new
economy, we continue "in depth" tonight with nbc's anne thompson.

'tis the season to send americans shipping -- 190 million packages
between thanksgiving and christmas, many purchased online. but
internet retailers, once a force behind the boom, now fighting for
their very survival. and many say the one to watch is etoys. 
<TURN>
etoys is in a very precarious position. this holiday season.

the one time dotcom wunderkind, 4 years old and still losing money
this season, trying to steady itself with a new delivery system. how
does a toy go from your computer screen to your christmas tree? to
find out, we ordered one of the season's hottest items -- a razor
scooter. the order went from chicago to ontario, california, where
it is processed, and suzanne horsey picks it off a shelf. 
<TURN>
i walk up and down these aisles probably about a million times.

she puts it on a cart. it's boxed and begins a half-mile trip. one
of tens of thousands of orders each day, this one is wrapped
packaged, labeled and, four hours later, shipped. 
<TURN>
everybody in the building knows that we're playing one game, and
that is speed and accuracy. 
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
in financial districts it's a different game. etoys needs cash. with
only enough money to survive, analysts say, until mid-2001, it needs
a strong holiday to revive investors' confidence. ken cassar, who
tracks these businesses, says etoys' hopes of doubling its holiday
sales this year to as much as $240 million is a difficult task in
this economy, especially when online sales, while still growing
quickly, will only increase at one-half last year's rate. 
<TURN>
the macroeconomic picture is not a pretty one because oil prices are
so high and consumers have less money in their pocketbooks. 
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
but they are spending money on scooters. our scooter is driven to
denver, sorted by zip code and then loaded to another truck and
brought to rainbow house, a children's charity. from the computer to
the christmas tree, and happiness for a child. etoys, an economic
symbol of the season. the question tonight, will it survive to help
play santa claus next year? anne thompson, nbc news, chicago.
