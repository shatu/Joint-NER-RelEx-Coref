Egypt has recalled its ambassador to Israel protesting what it calls
Israel's escalation of aggression against the Palestinians. Egypt's
Middle East news agency carried a foreign ministry statement that
said President Hosni Mubarak decided to recall the ambassador after
Israeli helicopter gunships attacked Palestinian targets in the Gaza
Strip on Monday. The statement did not say whether the recall was
temporary. President Mubarak is a strong supporter of moderation of
the Arab-Israeli conflict. He has said that a dialogue is the only
way to break the current wave of bloody clashes between Israeli
forces and the Palestinians. Israeli troops shot and killed at least
three more Palestinians in overnight clashes in Gaza.

Meanwhile, the head of the Palestinian Observer Mission to the
United Nations, Nasser al-Kidwa says any protection force sent to
the West Bank and Gaza must be under United Nations control. VOA
correspondent Breck Ardery, has more from the UN. 
<TURN>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with UN Secretary General Kofi
Annan, Mr. al-Kidwa disputed reports that the Palestinians would
accept an observer force that was not under UN control. 
<TURN>
We stressed the absolute need for the protection to be achieved
through a UN observer force composed of unarmed military observers
to be deployed throughout the territories occupied by Israel since
1967. 
<TURN>
Mr. al-Kidwa said only an observer force under UN jurisdiction would
have legitimate international authority. There had previously been
reports the Palestinians might accept an observer force from several
nations, but not under UN control. The Palestinians are urging the
UN Security Council to adopt a proposed resolution that would send
2000 unarmed observers to Gaza and the West Bank. Backers of the
resolution say the observers would provide a measure of protection
for Palestinian civilians. The United States has said it will not
support such a resolution unless both the Palestinians and the
Israelis agree to it. So far, Israel has rejected the idea. UN
Secretary General Annan is talking with both sides. Israeli UN
Ambassador, Yehuda Lancry had no substantial public comment after he
met with the Secretary General, except to say the meeting was
useful. Breck Ardery, VOA News at the United Nations.
