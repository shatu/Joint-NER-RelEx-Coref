This is The World. I am Lisa Mullins. Both George W. Bush and Al
Gore today continue to press their cases literally and figuratively.
Their PR machines seem to be functioning smoothly. Governor Bush's
running made Dick Cheney talk with reporters about the Republican
transition plans, another signal that Bush is getting ready to
become the next President of the United States. Meanwhile, Vice
President Gore continued his appeal for patience while he contests
Bush's claim to victory. And attorneys for both men were preparing
for key court battles later in the week, which could settle the
three-week dispute over who won Florida and the presidency. The
World's Clark Boyd has the latest.

All eyes were on Florida yet again today as lawyers, judges,
lawmakers and citizens, all picked at the knots that have tied up
the conclusion of this presidential election for the past three
weeks. Yesterday in Leon County Circuit Court, Judge N. Sander Sauls
set a Saturday deadline for a hearing on vote recounts and ordered
the roughly 14000 contested ballots in Miami Dade and Palm Beach
counties, not to mention a sample voting machine and voting booth,
to be brought to Tallahassee under police escort. Today, as
officials in both two counties ready the ballots for transport,
George W. Bush's lawyers asked the Judge to order all 1.16 million
ballots from the two counties to be trucked to the state capital.
Late this afternoon, Judge Sauls granted that motion. In Washington,
Vice President Al Gore was back on television this morning trying to
shore up public support for his legal cause. In a taped interview,
for NBC's Today Show, Gore said despite all the legal maneuvering he
is calling on both camps to put partisan politics aside. 
<TURN>
I think that both Governor Bush and I should recognize an obligation
during this time when the votes are still to be counted, to try to
restrain the passions of our partisan supporters. 
<TURN>
Meanwhile, Bush's vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney was a busy
man today. After a heart checkup at a Washington hospital he
appeared at a news conference to say that he is pressing ahead with
transition plans. 
<TURN>
We have now acquired office space in McClain, Virginia that will
become the site for the transition operation that we announced two
days ago. So we are just in a business of getting up and running,
but we now have an office with a lot of space, we have got people
signing up, volunteers coming on, telephones being put in and
computers. So we will be fully operational within the next day or
two. 
<TURN>
Earlier today in Florida, the Republican dominated legislature began
hearings on calling a special session to pick the states electors
itself, should the December 12th deadline still find the election
tied up in the courts. The Committee heard from angry voters and
precinct workers in Palm Beach. 
<TURN>
I believe our issues do relate directly to the appointing of
electors for the state of Florida. The electors need to be
appointed, are supposed to be appointed according to the will of the
people and I believe in Palm Beach County that it was very difficult
to determine what the will of the people was. 
<TURN>
Although Al Gore said today that he certainly feels like he won the
election, he put his odds of wining the various legal battles at
fifty-fifty. Gore said, if Bush does triumph in court, he will throw
his support behind the Republican president elect. But for now, says
former Clinton administration cabinet member Robert Riche, both
sides are positive that they've won the election. And says Riche,
the longer the fight goes on, the more troublesome the next four
years might be. 
<TURN>
What we risk by prolonging this is greater public cynicism and a
hardening of partisan lines among career politicians who have to
work together. After all, come January, these people are going to
have to be in Washington whether Gore or Bush is the President. You
have a lot of politicians in Congress who are going to have to work
together with the new President and with each other. So we don't
want to prolong this forever. 
<TURN>
The US Supreme Court will hear arguments from both sides on Friday
and Florida's Leon County Circuit Court will consider the arguments
on disputed state ballots on Saturday. And while the nation varies
of the protracted legal battle may be Leon County Circuit court
Judge N. Sander Sauls said it best. The whole process, he said, is a
bit like being nibbled to death by a duck. For The World, this is
Clark Boyd.
