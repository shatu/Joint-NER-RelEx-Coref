The United States and the European Union will start lifting economic
sanctions against Yugoslavia today. Among the sanctions imposed
against the regime of former President Slobodan Milosevic during the
fight over Kosovo over an oil embargo and a ban on commercial air
traffic. French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said Sunday that
relieving the pressure on Belgrade's devastated economy is the first
step towards supporting the new President Vojislav Kostunica and
reintegrating Yugoslavia into a democratic Europe.
