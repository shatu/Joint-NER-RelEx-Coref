I'm David Coler VOA News. Florida has announced the official results
of last Tuesday's presidential election. Florida Secretary of State,
Katherine Harris said that out of 6 million votes cast Republican
candidate George W. Bush received just 300 votes more than
Democratic candidate Al Gore. Ms. Harris also said that in obedience
to a court ruling she will consider amending the results based on
hand recounts in three Florida counties. 
<TURN>
In accordance with today's court ruling confirming my discretion in
these matters, I'm requiring a written statement of the facts and
circumstances that would cause these counties to believe that a
change should be made before the final certification of the
statewide vote. This written statement is due in our office by 2
p.m. tomorrow. 
<TURN>
At stake are Florida's 25 electoral votes. Whoever wins them will
become the next US President.
