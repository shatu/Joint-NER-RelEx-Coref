This is The World. I am Lisa Mullins. British police are puzzling
over an item of stolen property which has just been recovered. It's
the famous German wartime coding machine named 'Enigma'. The machine
was stolen six months ago from a museum that is north of London
where Britain's wartime code breakers had their headquarters. The
World's Stephen Beard reports on how a half-century after it last
saw active service, the 'Enigma' is still creating mystery. Born in
secrecy before the Second World War, the Enigma coding machine has
always been a source of intrigue. The latest chapter in a long and
convoluted story opened yesterday afternoon when a prominent BBC TV
newsman, Jeremy Paxman, received a suspicious package. 
<TURN>
It was a big-big cardboard box wrapped in parcel tape, inside, which
was double wrapped. Inside that was another box which was also
wrapped in parcel tape. Inside that was more bubble wrap, and
finally inside a third package was this wooden box. The moment I had
opened it about an inch, I thought, God, it is the missing Enigma
machine. 
<TURN>
The Enigma coding machine in question, which looks like an old
fashioned typewriter went missing last April from a glass case here
at the Bletchley Park Museum. It's a particularly rare version. Last
month the curator, Christine Lodge, began receiving a series of
bizarre coded letters demanding an equivalent of 35,000 dollars for
the return of the machine. 
<TURN>
We've just taken the letters absolutely on face value and there is
someone called 'the master' involved. There seems to be at least one
other person who is an intermediary. Beyond that we know nothing.
The letters from "the master" purportedly came from someone who
innocently bought the Enigma and then discovered subsequently, it
was stolen. He wanted 35,000 dollars to cover his loss. If he didn't
get the money, he said he would destroy the machine. This
cloak-and-dagger episode matches the history of Enigma. Despite its
clunking sound it was one of Hitler's secret weapons. Most of his
military communications were encoded with machines like this. His
confidence was not surprising, says John Gallohock, archivist at the
Bletchley Park Museum. The message writing process of each Enigma is
mind-bogglingly complex. 
<TURN>
You have got these three rotors each with 26 positions, 26 x 26 x
26. There are different rotors. These are all differently wired. You
have got three out of a set of five in different orders, 60
different combinations, and you have got ten stuck-up plugins here,
out of 26, that will add two million-million different combinations. 
<TURN>
The total number of settings was a 150 million-million-million, but
armed with some stolen code books and one or two of the machines a
small army of brilliant mathematicians based here at Bletchley Park
cracked the code and eavesdropped on German communications. This
breakthrough says Peter Westco, a museum trustee, had a decisive
impact on the course of the war. 
<TURN>
This is what gave us the edge. The intelligence of what the enemy
were up to. What they were going to do. And this is, of course, what
helped to reduce the war period by two to two-and-a half years,
saving lives of all nations throughout the world. This story does
not yet have a happy ending however. The stolen Enigma machine
returned by mail to the BBC is missing three of its coding wheel.
Without them says Peter Hamer, an Enigma expert, the machine has
lost much of its value. 
<TURN>
The machine just doesn't work without them and since this machine is
almost unique, I know of only one other machine of this type in
existence. You can't simply substitute any Enigma wheel of the many
thousands that exist from the other machines. 
<TURN>
Museum staff will not comment on claims that 'the master' has now
demanded 35,000 dollars to return the wheels. The package containing
the stolen machine doesn't apparently hold any clues. It was signed
by a P. Smith from a fictitious address in Birmingham, 312, Santos
Road. 312 is the machine's serial number. To quote Churchill, this
for the time being must remain a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside
an Enigma. For The World, this is Stephen Beard in London.
