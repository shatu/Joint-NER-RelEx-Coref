the u.s. government is warning american citizens living and
traveling abroad to be on alert as violence continues in the
mideast. the confrontations are casting a shadow over mideast peace
talks in paris. palestinian leader yasser arafat and israeli prime
minister ehud barak have been attending talks separately. they are
scheduled to hold another summit tomorrow in egypt. but palestinian
sources say arafat won't return to the table until three conditions
are met. he wants the israelis to end the fighting, remove israeli
tanks and helicopter gunships from palestinian residential areas and
agree to an international investigation into the violence. the
israeli government has rejected the notion of an international
commission. two palestinians were killed in clashes overnight.
shooting also erupted near a jewish settlement in the gaza. in the
west bank, a passenger was wounded when an israeli bus came under
fire. 58 people have been killed in six days of fighting.
