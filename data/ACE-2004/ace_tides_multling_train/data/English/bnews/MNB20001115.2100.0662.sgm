hold that thought, dafpblet here's the secretary of state in
florida. 
<TURN>
good evening. on tuesday evening, i requested those counties
contemplating manual vote recounts to submit a written statement to
me of the and circumstances justifying any belief on their part that
they should be allowed to amend their certified returns previously
filed by them in accordance of law. all three counties -- palm
beach, miami-dade and broward, responded by if 2:00 p.m. deadline
today and i thank them. copies of the responses have already been
distributed. additionally, colier county asked about the possibility
of an amendment to their return, unrelated to the manual recount
issue. a copy of that letter has also been distributed. for the past
week, i've devolted a substantial amount of my time to issues
surrounding the manual vote recount. after judge lewis' decision
yesterday morning, my staff and i, along with counsel, developed
criteria appropriate to the exercise of my discretion under florida
law. this criteria is clearly set forth in florida case law. for the
past six hours, i've applied these criteria in deliberating upon the
specific requests of the counties, contemplating manual vote
recounts. as a result of these deliberations, i've decided it is my
duty under plfl law to exercise -- florida law to exercise my
discretion in denying these requested amendments. the reasons given
in their requests are insufficient to warrant waiver of the
unambiguous filing deadline imposed by the florida legislature. i
have communicated this decision with these counties in letters
detailing the criteria i used in making my judgments. and the
application of these criteria to the stated circumstances. and
copies of these letters are also available. because it is my
determination that no amendments to the official returns, now on
file at the department of state, are warranted, the state elections
canvasing commission, acting in its normal and usual manner has
certified the results of tuesday's election in florida, including
the presidential election. copies of that portion of the
certification relating to the presidential election and the
signature pages of the certification are also available. as i
previously indicated, i expect that after the receipt, tabulation,
and certification of the overseas ballots by the counties, the state
elections canvasing commission will finally certify the presidential
election in florida on saturday. the schedule, of course, is subject
to judicial intervention. in that context, i once again will be
unable personally to answer questions. however, i have with me our
general counsel, debbie kerny and two of our outside counsel, joe
clock and deborah blanton and asked them to remain behind and answer
appropriate questions from you. one final comment. i want to
reassure the public that my decision in this process has been made
carefully, consistently, independently, and i believe correctly. i'm
very grateful for your patience and your understanding. thank you.
and god bless. mr. clock? 
<TURN>
thank you.
