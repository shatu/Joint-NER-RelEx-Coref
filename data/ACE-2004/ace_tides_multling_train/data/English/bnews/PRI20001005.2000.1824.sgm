From BBC News in London, I am James Cawling for The World. The whole
of Serbia has risen up against Slobodan Milosevic. Those were the
words of opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica to crowds in Belgrade.
In a television interview, Kostunica declared he had replaced
Milosevic as President. Earlier hundreds of thousands of people
filled the city center demanding Milosevic step down. Protestors
braved clouds of tear gas to take control of the Federal Parliament
building, which was set on fire and several television stations. An
announcer appeared on the main channel to announce the arrival of
free broadcasting. Journalist Misha Glenny was on the streets.

The Federal Parliament here is on fire. Demonstrators have moved
into it. Police are using tear gas all over the place, dispersing
many of the demonstrators, but frankly all hell has broken lose
here. 
<TURN>
The whereabouts of Slobodan Milosevic remain unclear at this hour,
but opposition leader Alexander Popovic says it's now clear his time
and power is over. 
<TURN>
I think that the majority of the people who are betting that this is
the day, this is the end, that today is the end or maybe tomorrow,
but that it's over, that you are going to be free.
