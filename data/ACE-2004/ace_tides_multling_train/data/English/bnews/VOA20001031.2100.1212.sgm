Major League baseball's National League champion New York Mets
fortified their teams leadership on Tuesday by resigning Manager
Bobby Valentine and General Manager Steve Phillips. One of the Mets
owners, Nelson Doubleday told a New York newspaper that Valentine's
contract was for three years at $7.5 million and with Phillips was
for three years at $3 million. The fifty-year-old Valentine replaced
Dallas Green as the Mets manager on August 26th, 1996. Since then,
he has led the team to four consecutive winning seasons, including
back-to-back post season berths and the franchise's first trip to
the World Series in 14 years. Valentine said he knew he wanted to
stay in New York. 
<TURN>
We think after the last game when Mike and Fonse and Alan John
amongst the others, came in and literally asked me to stay. That I
knew at that time, probably could have offered a lot less, that I
was going to stay. 
<TURN>
Valentine had been under contract through midnight Tuesday, while
Phillips was under contract through December. By resigning Valentine
before his contract expired, the Mets avoided a bidding war for his
services. The Cincinnati Reds had expressed an interest in him and
the Los Angeles Dodgers, Philadelphia Phillies, and Toronto Blue
Jays are also without managers.
