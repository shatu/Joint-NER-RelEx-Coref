israeli helicopter gunships opened fire on a palestinian position in
bethlehem overnight. the army says the choppers were firing on
gunmen who were shooting at rachel's tomb for several hours. that
holy shrine is the traditional burial place of the biblical
matriarch. at least 25 palestinians were wounded in gun battles with
israeli troops yesterday. earlier, two israeli soldiers were stabbed
at a roadblock north of jerusalem. meantime, aides to israeli prime
minister ehud barak say israel is willing to cooperate with a
u.s.-led inquiry into the violence that has killed at least 319
people. investigators are expected to arrive in mid-december.
