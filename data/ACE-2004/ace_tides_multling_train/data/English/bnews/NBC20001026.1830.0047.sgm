good evening. there isn't a national poll in the race between vice
president al gore and governor george w. bush that shows a clear
advantage for one or the other with two weekends to go. according to
today's msnbc/reuters tracking poll, gore is hanging onto a
two-point lead over bush for the second day in a row. but all these
polls, it's important to point out , are within a margin of error
that could flip the results. what they're really telling us is that
the race appears to be a dead heat. and with time running short, the
final strategies are taking a sharper form. nbc's david gregory is
with the governor again tonight, claire shipman with the vice
president. claire, the gore campaign worried about ralph nader.

tom, the greening of al gore today -- his environmental message
hasn't always been a priority on the campaign trail, but now, with
fears of ralph nader's growing support, it could be critical. al
gore, today hopscotching across the midwest, reminding voters of his
environmentalist credentials. 
<TURN>
together, we can clean up the environment.

message in diners.

one that i've worked on a lot, one people don't talk about, is

<TURN>
the environment is at stake in this election. 
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
why? it's a message that appeals to those critical undecided voters
and especially the supporters of this man, ralph nader. once a minor
distraction, gore aides now fear nader could cost them the election.
how much can nader hurt? take oregon, a state gore was counting on.
a recent poll has bush at 45%, gore at 41% and nader at 10%. in
traditionally democratic minnesota, bush has 44%, gore 41%, nader
8%. here in wisconsin, gore has an edge in one poll, bush in
another. nader remains steady at 5%. those statistics have democrats
cranking up the head on nader supporters. former gore rival bill
bradley, on the stump today in washington state. pro-choice
organizations are spending big money for ads like this one to make
the case that a vote for nader could mean the end of a woman's right
to choose. 
<TURN>
before voting nader, consider the risk. it's your choice.
environmental groups are also getting involved. some prominent
democrats are thinking about a full-page ad in "the new york times."
and look for states like oregon and minnesota to figure prominently
on gore's travel schedule in the final week. tom?

thanks very much, nbc's claire shipman tonight. as for governor
bush, he had some high-powered help today on the campaign trail and
a more pointed commentary on the vice president. nbc's david gregory

tom, making it abundantly clear that the clinton/gore scandals of
the past eight years will be a major theme in the closing days of
this campaign, bush attacks the vice president for being a failed
leader and promises if he's elected americans will once again be
able to respect their government. bush campaigns today in this tough
battleground state alongside the popular retired general colin
powell and again hints strongly powell will be a member of his
cabinet if elected. today's address focuses on "responsible
leadership" and how on issues like social security and medicare, the
clinton/gore administration has failed to pr 
<TURN>
they are going out as they came in -- their guide, the nightly
polls. their goal, the morning headlines. their legacy, the
fruitless search for a legacy.

<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
with the race so tight, advisers are hunkered down trying to for the
final push. plotting out the final push that, aides say, is likely
to include visits to eight different states bill clinton carried the
last two elections. tom? 
<TURN>
david gregory tonight with governor bush, not with vice president
gore, obviously.
