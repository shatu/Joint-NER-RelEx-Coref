al gore won't be the next u.s. president, but he has a slim chance
of becoming the next president at harvard. gore holds a degree from
the university, and is one of about 500 people nominated for the
job. a school official talked about the vice president's chances
during an interview with "the boston globe." he says it's unlikely
gore will be selected, because he doesn't have enough experience in
the academic world.
