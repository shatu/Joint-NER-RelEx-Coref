and now making hockey history -- the record for most victories by a
goaltender in the national hockey league has been held by terry
sawchuck of the detroit red wings since 1961. and now comes patrick
roy of the colorado avalanche. here's abc's brian rooney. 
<TURN>
in 16 years with the national hockey league, patrick roy has stopped
the other team from scoring 21,000 times, frequently doing the
impossible. 
<TURN>
do you believe that? highway robbery. 
<TURN>
and the amazing thing is, he almost never sees the puck. 
<TURN>
no, i don't see the puck most of the time, especially when it's
really fast or at close range. it's more anticipating it. 
<TURN>
he follows the action with his eyes, and just knows where the puck
will go. he plays what is known as butterfly style, splitting his
legs, often playing from his knees, filling the net with his 6'1"
body. 
<TURN>
90% of the time, when you're coming down on patrick, all you see is
his big jersey and the equipment, and you just don't see net, so
there's room to shoot. 
<TURN>
roy has his quirks. he talks to the goalposts and refuses to step on
the red and blue lines. he writes the names of his three children on
his stick before every game. but he says the most important thing is
not superstition, not ev talent. 
<TURN>
i think the passion. if you love what you're doing, and if you're a
passionate person, i mean, that will make the difference in the end. 
<TURN>
when he breaks the record for most wins, patrick roy will replace
detroit's late terry sawchuk in the record books. from george vezina
in the to gump worsely, who had a face stitched like a quilt, and
roy's hero, rogie vachon, pioneer of an aggressive style, the goalie
has been the loner of the end of the rink. they used to play without
a mask, but now the game is faster and the puck flies at 100 miles
an hour. 
<TURN>
years ago, the goaltenders were kind of the guys that couldn't play
defense, couldn't play forward, maybe weren't good skaters. so they
put them in net. today, i think they're as good an athlete as any
other player on the team. 
<TURN>
and patrick roy has established a standard that the goalie has to be
an athlete on a par with the best of any sport. he has won the
stanley cup three times. 
<TURN>
i just wanted to survive, you know. i just wanted to break that
league and survive in it as long as i could, and being in that
position today is something big for me. 
<TURN>
he loves to play, which is just another thing that might make him
the greatest goalie the game has ever had. brian rooney, c news,
