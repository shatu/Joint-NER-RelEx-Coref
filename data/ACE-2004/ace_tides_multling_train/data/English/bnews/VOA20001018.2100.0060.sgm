I'm David Coller, VOA News. Dozens of Palestinians were wounded in
scattered clashes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Wednesday,
despite the Sharm el-Sheikh truce accord. The clashes occurred as
the Palestinian leadership issued orders to observe the troops. The
Palestinian leaders also warned that Israel must remove its soldiers
from the outskirts of Palestinian cities. Israel says, it has lifted
the internal restrictions that barred Palestinians from moving among
West Bank towns and villages.
