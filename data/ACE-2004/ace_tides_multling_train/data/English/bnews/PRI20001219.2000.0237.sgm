China released a government policy paper today about population and
development. The paper said Beijing helps to cap its population at
1.6 billion by the year 2050. NPR's Rob Gifford reports from the
Chinese capital.

The Chinese government today credited the one child policy with
dramatically improving the quality of life for citizens of the
world's most populous nation. China's population currently stands at
1.26 billion, still the largest in the world. But the paper says
that if it weren't for the one child policy that figure would be 300
million higher. The White paper says the economy still faces a
daunting challenge coping with the net annual increase of 10 million
people over the next decade. At the same time, it says, China will
grapple with problems associated with a rapidly aging population and
lack of an extensive social security system. Rob Gifford, NPR news,
Beijing.
