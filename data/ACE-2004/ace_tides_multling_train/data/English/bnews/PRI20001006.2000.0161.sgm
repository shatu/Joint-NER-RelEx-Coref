Former U.S. representative Sidney Yates has died. When he retired
last year, he was the oldest and longest serving member of the
house. NPR's Sheryl Corley reports from Chicago. 
<TURN>
Sidney Yates was first elected to the U.S. house in 1948, when Harry
Truman was President and for more than 4 decades he trounced every
challenger to face him in congressional election. He sat out 1 term
after losing a U.S. Senate race in the 1960s. But for 24 terms,
Yates represented Chicago's Northern Lake front in northern suburbs.
The congressman was known as a fervent liberal and supporter of the
arts and he was noted for his success in getting congress to finance
for national endowment for the art. In 1993, Yates was awarded a
Presidential Citizens Medal for his efforts. Yates was born in
Chicago and he was one of the few politicians who successfully
walked the tight rope between the Chicago machine and its
independent critics. He died yesterday of renal failure and
complications from pneumonia. Sheryl Corley, NPR news, Chicago.
