And if you are in South Asia, perhaps you heard the Radio Canada
International test transmissions to your part of the world back on
the 8th, 9th, and 10th of November. They were via Radio Netherlands
at Flavo, the Netherlands 15:00-16:00 UTC on 15360 and 17820, that
according to Andy Senet ,via Glenhouser. RCI tells me that it is not
yet decided whether it will start a permanent service to South Asia.
