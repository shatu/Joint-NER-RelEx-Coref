duane walker, "cnn headline sports." week ten of the nfl season, and
for the first time in a washington redskins uniform, jeff george
will get the starting nod at quarterback against the arizona
cardinals. brad johnson is out because of a sprained knee ligament. 
<TURN>
i would think where we're at that brad will be out of the game. my
guess is -- i mean, i'd like him to be at least be able to dress,
but i'm not sure he'll even be able to do that. if we where he s and
be an emergency third, that would probably be the best we could hope
for.
