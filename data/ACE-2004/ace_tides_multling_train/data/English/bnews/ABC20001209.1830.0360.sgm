in yesterday's ruling from florida supreme's court, the chief
justice warned recounting undervotes in the counties would cause
"confusion and disorder." in some places today those words appeared
prophetic. mike von fremd from jacksonville.

when the supreme court issued its decision to stop, observers in the
counting room were told to leave. 
<TURN>
are you serious? 
<TURN>
as soon as i see it in writing, if it says stop, i will stop. we're
stopping right now until i see if we need to keep on stopping. 
<TURN>
the process stopped before a single ballot was counted. tempers
flared early on after the republican chairman of the canvassing
board announced in advance that it was impossible to meet tomorrow's
p.m. deadline. 
<TURN>
no possible way.

if he cannot carry out his constitutional duty to do this, then he
should do as the judge in tallahassee did, recuse himself. put
somebody there who can get it done! cheers and applause

<TURN>
from beginning to end, both sides fought every step of the way. this
morning they could not decide how to begin. tonight, the two sides
are arguing about what to do now that they have been told to stop.
democrats say, at least sort the ballots. republicans said, no way.
