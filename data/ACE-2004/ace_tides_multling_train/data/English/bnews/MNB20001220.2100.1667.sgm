we have an update tonight on this, the volcano in mexico, they call
ell popo. just 24 hours after its interruption in more than 1,000
years, the worst appears to be over. but there is still the possibly
of great danger to the tens of thousands of people who live nearby.
our report on this tonight from kevin tibbles. 
<TURN>
as the sun rises over mt. popo tonight, the only hint of the fire
storm inside, whiffs of smoke. but just a few hours earlier, the
volcano exploding spewing rock and red-hot lava. the fourth largest
mountain in north american, nearly 18,000 feet high, erupting this
week with its most violent out burs in 1200 years. they say it is an
especially dangerous volcano because it of its steep slopes. it
could potentially wipe out everything its path. 40,000 people live
in the path. here at the national natural disaster prevention
center, they are working around the clock. it is here they take the
volcano's pulse, calling it unstable, saying popo is simply
recharging, getting ready to erupt again. 
<TURN>
it's acquiring more pressure. and eventually this pressure will be
released in the -- in the future days. 
<TURN>
the danger? the heat from popo's lava flow is melting the flashiers
on the -- glaciers on the sides of the mountain and could trigger
mud slides. 
<TURN>
it's like concrete coming down instead of water. so, they will
destroy anything in its -- that tries to stop them. 
<TURN>
the mexican government is taking no chances. it sent out 1,000
troops to force an evacuation inside an eight-mile radius. tonight,
20,000 people in shelters, but another 20,000 refuse to leave,
worried about their corn harvests who -- or who would feed their
animals. if a major danger was to come, says this man, then we've
got to run. there's no other choice. scientists say popo has a huge
crater about half a mile across, about 300 feet deep and a lava dome
is building up like an upside down grapefruit. in contrast, mt.
saint helen had a dome, almost as if it was pregnant. randy white,
who has done on site studies of this mountain, monitors the rhythms. 
<TURN>
it is blowing in its own way. it could get bigger. we don't know how
to predict it exactly. 
<TURN>
for centuries here, the people have had almost a mystical
relationship with popo, believing the volcano is a god, showering
their crops with rain. tonight, they fear it will turn vengeful,
bringing destruction after 1200 years of peace.
