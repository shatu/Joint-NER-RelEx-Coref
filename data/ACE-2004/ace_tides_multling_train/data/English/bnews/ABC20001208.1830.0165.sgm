the shock waves rushed across the country. in washington, where the
gore campaign had steeled themselves to lose, in texas, where bush
and his team were convinced democrats on the florida supreme court
were determined to win this one for mr. gore. mr. bush's lawyers are
rushing to the supreme court of the united states for assistance.
there was no major reaction on wall street. markets had closed.
everywhere else in the country, americans were stopped momentarily
in their tracks to think of the mess that may lie ahead. first
question, how can florida count the votes in 64 counties when it
took this much to get a partial count in three? let's go back to
abc's erin hayes.

peter, here in the capital they are just about ready to go. in
tallahassee in a courthouse, ,000 votes from miami-dade county.
those votes there had been preparations just in case. 
<TURN>
if we use 25 teams, then that roughly adds up to little less than
500 ballots per team. and we figure we could probably conclude that
within an eight-hour time. 
<TURN>
but then, for the rest of the state, some counties haven't separated
the undervotes from the rest of the ballots. where to start? and
what to count? there was almost no guidance from the court on how to
do it. 
<TURN>
in tabulating what constitutes a legal vote, the standard to be used
is the one provided by the legislature. a vote shall be counted
where there is a clear indication of the intent of the voter. 
<TURN>
exactly the kind of ambiguity that has kept the legal battle muddy
and ongoing for 31 days. 
<TURN>
we don't know what the standards will be. we don't know who will
count them. we don't know whether or not she will be counted in time
for them to count in the electoral college. 
<TURN>
the court was deeply divided. judge wells said -- the concern among
many is that this decision now leads so many questions t. would
appear very little time to find the answers. 
<TURN>
thanks.
