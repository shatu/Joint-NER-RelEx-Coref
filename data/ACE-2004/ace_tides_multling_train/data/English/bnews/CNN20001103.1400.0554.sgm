a runway mix-up apparently caused tuesday's plane crash in taiwan.
investigators say the singapore airlines jet should have been on
runway five-left, but instead, it was on five-right. a parallel
runway. the plane hit construction equipment. that's part of it
right there. investigators say they don't know why it was on the
wrong runway. it was raining at the time. they hope the plane's
flight recorder will help solve the mystery. the pilot is being kept
in taiwan for questioning. 81 people were killed in the accident,
which took place amid poor visibility and driving rain. the airport
has no ground radar, so air traffic controllers could not have known
the pilot took a wrong turn.
