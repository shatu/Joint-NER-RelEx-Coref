the mariners can move on to the american league champion shn series
with a win over the white sox this afternoon. seattle is obviously
upbeat and relaxed after taking the first two games in chicago. 
<TURN>
i think this team is energize99 energized. i think we feel real
good. and, you know, after that anaheim series, i think this whole
team took a deep breath of relief and said, okay, we're finally in.
let's go out and do our thing. 
<TURN>
as long as we go out and have fun and laugh and, you know, i think
it takes a lot of pressure off of everyone. but the key is going out
and having fun. laughing and joking around. you know, doing the
little things that we've been doing all year.
