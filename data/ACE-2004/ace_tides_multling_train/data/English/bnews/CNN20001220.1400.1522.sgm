an electrical engineer in australia is making the holidays brighter
for thousands of people. denise dillon reports this is not your
ordinary christmas light display. 7777 
<TURN>
welcome to len doof's house in adelaide, australia. that's right.
all this is one man's personal christmas decoration. it's his annual
christmas display, and tens of thousands of people come to see the
blinking, spinning, twirling lights and hear the holiday music.
there are more than 52,000 lights, all synchronized to christmas
carols. it takes more than 10 1/2 miles of cable and wire to hook it
all up, and 23 computers. this is definitely a high-tech christmas
display. doof, who is an electrical engineer, says his vision for
the display was ahead of its time. 
<TURN>
i actually had a dream about it a long time ago, and dreamt up, you
know, the chips to put in the computers to make it work. and that
was 20 years ago, before chips were anything other than fish and
chips.

over the past 20 years, the display has gotten bigger and brighter,
and doof says this one is the biggest yet. he spends long hours on
his elaborate display. he started working on it last march. he pays
careful attention to all the fine details. every year, he hand
paints about 30,000 of the tiny globes that decorate his home. doof
says he goes to such extremes for one reason. 
<TURN>
this is christmas. it's my christmas present to everybody. it's my
christmas present to myself, and by people coming to see it, that
makes me very happy, and i hope i make them very happy. 7777
