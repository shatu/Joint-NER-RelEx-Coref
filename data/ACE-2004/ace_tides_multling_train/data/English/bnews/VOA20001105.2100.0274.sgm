Brazilian officials say an oil tanker has crashed into a pier in a
resort area, spilling more than 86,000 liters of crude oil into the
ocean. The state-owned Petro Basque tanker hit the concrete pier in
San Sebastian, a popular resort south of Sao Paulo. Workers sealed
the leaking hull and contained the spill. But authorities say the
oil is still threatening local beaches. Saturday's incident was the
sixth Petro Basque spill this year.
