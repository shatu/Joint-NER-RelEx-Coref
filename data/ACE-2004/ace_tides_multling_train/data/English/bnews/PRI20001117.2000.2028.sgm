This is The World, a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI and
WGBH in Boston. I am Tony Kahn. Al Gore has won a victory in the
fight for the White House this evening. The Florida Supreme Court
has ruled that certification of election results in the State cannot
be made this weekend. The court will hear more arguments on that,
Monday. The tally of the State's overseas absentee ballots is also
underway this hour, with Gore so far trailing George W Bush, though
still by a small margin.
