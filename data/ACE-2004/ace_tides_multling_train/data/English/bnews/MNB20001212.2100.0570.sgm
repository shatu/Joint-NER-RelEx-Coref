let's check in with the court where it's tea law enforcement watch.
dan abrams outside the building. dan, if you had to make a case that
it could be tonight, what are the signs? 
<TURN>
well, i think the number one most important sign is looking at what
happened last night. and that is last night at about 7:00, the
public information officer of the court came to us and said we're
going home. we are told, in effect, there won't be a ruling tonight.
that hasn't happened tonight. now, you know the time ticking away
and yet they are still here. everyone still here. all we know is
that justices breyer and souter have been seen driving away. but
that doesn't necessarily tell us anything. there are all sorts of
possible explanations for that. it could be that they're not
actually involved in finishing up writing one of the opinions.
remember, very often, the justices are join in another justice's
opinion. it also could be that the opinion is already finished. and,
of course, there's always the possibility that it's not finished.
but i think the fact that the public information office and many
security officers here at the court are still here tells us that the
court is in all likelihood still working on this case. 
<TURN>
dan abrams, outside the court, still active court tonight. thank you
for that.
