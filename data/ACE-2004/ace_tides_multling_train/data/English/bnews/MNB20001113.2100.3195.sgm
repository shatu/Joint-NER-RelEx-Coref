finally tonight, humor as perspective. and for that, we depend on
the staff and crew of "saturday night live" who this weekend took on
the deadlocked election. here now a sampleling. 
<TURN>
good evening, america. i'm vice president al gore. 
<TURN>
andht'm the governor of texas. george w. bush. 
<TURN>
as you know, this election has been the closest in history. and the
results is still in dispute. 
<TURN>
that's right. it's in dispute because some people don't know when
they got beat. like in florida, i got 2,910,198 votes. and he got a
measley 2,909,827. eat it, gore. 
<TURN>
it's also in dispute because some people in this race cannot accept
losing a popularity contest.ay if you'll check the national popular
vote, you'll see that i al gore have been proven to be ipso facto,
the most popular man in america. heck, i'm this close to having
teenage girls throw their panties at me. 
<TURN>
but listen, we may have our differences, but i don't want to be
dividers. we want to be ynificators. -- unificator s. 
<TURN>
so a solution has been found that's both fair and consistent with
the will of the american people. 
<TURN>
we're both going to be president. heck, you all didn't know who you
wanted anyway. 
<TURN>
it's true. it's gong to be great. hey, c.j., roll that tape. 
<TURN>
on november, 7, george w. bush and al goran for president, but there
was no clear winner, so they decided to govern together. could they
share the white house without driving each other crazy?
