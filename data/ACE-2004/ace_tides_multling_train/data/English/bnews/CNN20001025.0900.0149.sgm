george w. bush is campaigning in the hotly contested sunshine state
today. bush is stumping with his brother jeb, who is governor of the
state. also on hand, arizona senator john m cain. meanwhile, gore is
expected to deliver what aides are calling a major speech on
education in tennessee this morning. the vice president is
campaigning with running mate joe lieberman. polls in gore's home
state show him nearly even with bush. nationwide, the race appears
to be seesawing back and forth. 
<TURN>
we have not seen the lead change hands, after labor day, according
to the gallup poll, in a presidential election since 1980. this is
the first time. in 1984, 1988, 1992 and 1996, the candidate who was
ahead on labor day never went behind. now, unless i've lost track,
because a's been a little hard to keep track, today is the fifth
lead change in gallup polling after labor day between gore and bush.
the lead did change hands. yesterday's cnn/"usa today"/gallup
tracking poll shows gore with a slight edge for the first time in
two weeks. the new numbers show that if the election were held
today, 46% of the likely voters questioned would choose gore. 45%
would choose bush. but the pollsters say the change is statistically
insignificant when the margin of error is considered.
