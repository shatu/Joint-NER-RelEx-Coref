bush is in the toss-up state of michigan, trying to turn the focus
of the campaign back to the issues. he told a rally in grand rapids
a key concern is what to do with the federal tax surplus. 
<TURN>
today in america, people pay more in federal, state and local taxes
than they do in food and clothing and housing. i want you to think
about that. the average family is working harder and longer hours,
and paying more in taxes than on the basic necessities to live. this
isn't right, folks. we need to send some of your money back to the
people who pay the bills. we ought to provide tax relief for
everybody who pays taxes in america! in addition to his stop in
grand rapids, bush's schedule for the day includes a visit to
university center, michigan. he will be joined there by retired
general colin powell, and will outline his proposals for repairing
what he calls a weakening of the u.s. military under the clinton
administration. from michigan, bush flies to morgantown, west
virginia, where he also will focus on military issues. west virginia
has the highest per capita number of veterans of foreign wars in the
u.s.
