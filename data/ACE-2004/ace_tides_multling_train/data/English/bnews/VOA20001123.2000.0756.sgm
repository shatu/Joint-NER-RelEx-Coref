Leaders of the European Union and five Balkan states meet in Zagreb
today to hail a new era of cooperation in a region that has been
torn by conflict. Douglas Paction has more on the story. 
<TURN>
The summit, which is being sponsored by the European Union, is meant
to show the Balkan states that the EU is preparing to welcome them
into the European family. Christina Gayat, a spokeswoman for EU
Foreign Policy Chief Javier Solana, says the summit has an important
symbolic value. 
<TURN>
I think it will be the occasion to welcome at the highest level of
the European Union under the highest level of the region, the very
dramatic changes that have occurred since the beginning of the year
and to further consolidate democracy and reconciliation.

Analysts say, last month's formal ouster of Slobodan Milosevic in
presidential elections in Yugoslavia was a pivotal event for the
region. The leaders of the five Balkan states of the summit,
Yugoslavia, Croatia, Macedonia, Albania and Bosnia are expected to
adopt a declaration calling for a political dialogue and regional
economic cooperation. The European Union is offering a 3.9
billion-dollar financial aid program to help the region, which has
long been devastated by civil conflict, economic collapse and
political isolation. In return the Balkan leaders will be called
upon to continue moving toward democracy and a market economy. The
leaders will also be asked to take steps to fight organized crime,
drug trafficking, and money laundering. Also at the Zagreb Summit,
Macedonia is expected to sign an association and stabilization pact
with the European Union. This is a first step on the long road to
full EU membership. Douglas Paction for VOA News, Luxembourg.
