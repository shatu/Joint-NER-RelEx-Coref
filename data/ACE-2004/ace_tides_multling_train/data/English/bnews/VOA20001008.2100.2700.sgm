01:45 Universal Time. This is VOA News now. A new and simple blood
test may soon be available to help doctors tell which of their
diabetic patients is most likely to develop crippling and
life-threatening complications. VOA's Jessica Berman explains.

Researcher Andrew Levi says scientists have long being puzzled by
the question of which diabetics develop complications and why. 
<TURN>
We know that the complications are directly related to a couple of
things. One is how long you've had the diabetes, how well you've
been controlled, but it's clear that people with the same level of
control of their glucose, same duration of the diabetes differ
dramatically in their susceptibility to these complications that are
so devastating. 
<TURN>
Dr. Levi says one third of insulin taking patients ends up with
kidney failure and 80% develop blinding eye disease. Scientists have
suspected there must be something different about the genetic make
up of diabetics who develop complications; and that difference may
have to do with haptoglobin, a protein whose function is to mop up
blood vessel destroying free radicals. The free radicals are
released when oxygen carrying red blood cells called haemoglobin
die. Andrew Levi says there are three different types of haptoglobin
and he and his colleagues at Israel's Technion Institute have found
that one type of haptoglobin called Type 1-1 appears protective
against diabetic complications while the other two types do not.
Researchers at Technion Institute led by Dr. Levi have developed a
simple blood test to let doctors and patients know who is most
likely to develop diabetic complications.

In a person that's not at high risk, when I tell them to go out and
start eating badly and not worrying about it, no, that would be not
warranted because they are certainly are going to be other
complications potentially in diabetes that are not going to be
explained by this type. I'll tell you that what I'm most excited
about this test I think is simple to apply and I think we can
appreciate its immediate use in trying to figure out who is at high
risk. But because I really think it gives us a real insight into how
to prevent these complications, what I'm really excited about is we
are really going to find out an oral simple medication here. It's
going to basically reproduce what the haptoglobin 1-1 type is doing
and I think that we are going to be able to basically make people
equivalent to haptoglobin Type 1-1. It's the type to prevent these
complications from developing. 
<TURN>
Israeli researchers recently described in the New England Journal of
Medicine, the results of a small trial with the blood test. Of 12
participants with the more protective haptoglobin only one had eye
disease. Robert Sherwin is President of the American Diabetes
Association. Dr. Sherwin says a haptoglobin test looks promising. 
<TURN>
Because right now we don't have any such test available. We treat
all people the same way. There is no question that if one could
identify prospectively people at risk the approach to therapy would
be very different in different individuals and clearly those people
who are at greatest risk we would be much quicker and intervening
more aggressively in various aspects of care. 
<TURN>
The blood test is currently undergoing large-scale clinical trials
in Israel, the first step toward getting it approved by government
regulators around the world. Jessica Bermen, VOA News, Washington.
