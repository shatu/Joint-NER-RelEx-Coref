Ecuador's economy is showing strong improvement. Ecuador's Central
Bank reports a healthy economic recovery with growth in the second
trimester of 2.4 percent. This follows the country's bold move to
dollarize the economy. VOA's Greg Flankis reports from Quito, while
the plan is working, economists still see some problems ahead.

Driving through the narrow streets of downtown Quito, taxi driver
Abdun Mesios has nothing but praise for the dollarization of his
country's economy. He says things are more stable now and that the
transition from the former currency known as the Sucre has not been
difficult.

He says that people who work with the public are having to make
change everyday and so they learned fast how to work with the money
from the United States. When the sixth month transition ended last
month and all transactions in Ecuador moved to the dollar system,
many merchants found they were short of change. Jacqueline, who
works in a small shop near Quito's Cathedral, says lack of coins is
the biggest problem.

She says it happens all the time and that she loses money because
they don't have enough coins to make change. The Ecuadorian
government has minted coins that resemble US coins in an effort to
provide more small change for merchants, but it has taken some time
to reach all areas. In small rural communities in the countryside,
because not enough dollars have made it into circulation there. But
the government and President Gustavo Nobora considers these to be
short-term problems and views the overall policy as a grand success.
Most people in the financial community agree. Economist Maria
Delapasvela, who works with the magazine Rabista Hastion says
adopting the US dollar has put an end to Ecuador's crisis atmosphere
characterized by runs on banks and other disruptions.

She says the immediate effect of the dollarization has been the
stabilization of the economy. She says 1998 and 1999 were years in
which Ecuador suffered the worst economic crisis in its history.
During that time, she notes, the Sucre went from just over 6,000 to
the dollar to almost 25,000 to the dollar. Maria Delapasvela says
conducting business in Ecuador had become a real challenge as
factory and storeowners needed to keep an eye on currency
fluctuation almost on an hourly basis in order to plan their
purchases and sales. She says inflation is now on the decline and
bank deposits are increasing. The transition to dollars was eased
somewhat by a sharp increase in oil prices in the past year, which
allowed oil-producing Ecuador to buy plenty of dollars on the
international market. But Maria Delapasvela says now is the time to
start thinking about what happens when the situation changes.

She asks what will happen when oil prices go back down and the
country can no longer bring in sufficient dollars to sustain its
economy. The Ecuadorian economist says now is the time for the
government to implement fiscal reforms and to stimulate
competitiveness and diversification in the economy. She says the
Nobora government is rightfully proud of the immediate short-term
effects of its dollarization policy, but that it needs to
concentrate on the medium and long-term outlook. She says, unless
the government develops a plan soon to address Ecuador's fundamental
structural problems, the use of the US dollar as a medium of
exchange will not be enough to keep the country's economy healthy.
The experiment in Ecuador is being watched closely not only by the
United States, which receives a certain benefit from the increased
demand for dollars, but by other nations in the region. The concept
of dollarization has been discussed from Argentina to Mexico in the
past few years. Some US economists, in fact, had viewed Ecuador as a
poor place to test the idea since its economy is still burdened by
heavy external debt and its export sector is relatively undeveloped.
Still, as one observer puts it, officials in some nations may
conclude that if dollarization can work here in Ecuador, it can work
anywhere. Greg Flykus, VOA News, Quito, Ecuador.
