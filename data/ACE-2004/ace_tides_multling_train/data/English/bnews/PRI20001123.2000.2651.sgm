In New Delhi today, Indians like Americans are consuming their
favorite traditional foods, roties, dal and increasingly burgers and
fries. The golden arches and the Kentucky kernel are becoming
familiar sites in the country and as the Worlds Tinku Ray reports,
many Indians are giving a fast welcome to fast food. 
<TURN>
Visit any McDonalds in the capital and it will be packed with
families, the young and old enthusiastically eating their burgers
and fries. The American fast food giant opened its first outlet in
India four years ago and has now expanded to twenty-five around the
country. But imagine a McDonalds without beef, no big macs, no
cheese burgers, instead the choice is McAlu tikki burger or chicken
kebabs. Vikram Bakshi, Managing Director of McDonalds India explains
the customized menu. 
<TURN>
We knew that we were in a country, which is culturally sensitive.
From day one we went beefless and porkless, so we could look after
the sentiments of both the Hindus and the Muslims. From day one we
knew that there was an issue about vegetarianism, we had to be very
conscious about it and we did a segregation in our kitchens, which
has been unheard of. 
<TURN>
And the strategy has been a popular one for McDonalds, as a sample
poll of lunchtime customers outside a restaurant in South Delhi
shows. 
<TURN>
We get a lot of variety here and it's very tasty also. 
<TURN>
If they offered you only, say, a fully western menu, would it still
appeal to you? 
<TURN>
No, no that's not good. I think it should be both, the Western and
the Indian, both. 
<TURN>
The food here offered is a lot better than what you find in the US. 
<TURN>
In what ways? 
<TURN>
Here, you know, it's like it's American and as well as Indian taste.
It's a very wise move on for them because if they would have only
just original McDonalds, I don't think they would have done so
great. I think by blending things, you know, they have done a very
wise move.

Along the narrow crowded streets of old Delhi, is where you can find
fast food, Indian style. These are roadside restaurants often called
dhabas that serve up recipes of dal, vegetables and stuffed puries,
deep-fried in oil. This traditional and cheap fair has proved stiff
competition for the multinational fast food chains, but they've been
fighting hard and maybe closing in. Pizza delivery chain Dominos
turned a profit for the first time last year, after five years in
the Indian market. Dominos has also adapted to Indian tastes by
creating special toppings, butter chicken and chana masala pizzas.
The simple idea of home delivery is also rather new to India, but
seems to have captured people's imagination. Dominos Chief
Executive, Pawan Bhatia says, the secret of their success is to
introduce Western brands with an Indian twist. 
<TURN>
If I walk in to a lot of the companies who failed and if you put
this, have they given a choice and the answer most of the time will
be no. They have decided the menu. 
<TURN>
India is a deeply religious and traditional country, but in the past
decade thanks to globalization and cable TV, the population has been
exposed to dozens of multinational brands from burgers to washing
machines and pizzas to Pepsi. But despite the desire to embrace
globalization, there is still a reluctance to change completely.
Marketing analyst, Sohail Seth, believes that fast food companies
will only survive if they take seriously the need to be culturally
sensitive. 
<TURN>
As a nation we don't like to experiment too much, so food is such a
personal item, it's such an important item of our daily existence
that the last thing we'd like is any international fast food company
coming in and tinkering with our palate. 
<TURN>
Ironically, what the Western fast food chains are doing here is the
same as what Indian restaurants have done and been very successful
at in the United States and Europe, adapting and adjusting according
to local tastes. For The World, this is Tinku Ray, New Delhi.
