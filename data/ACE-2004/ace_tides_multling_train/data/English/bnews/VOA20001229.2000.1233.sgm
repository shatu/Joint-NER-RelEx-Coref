Meanwhile, at the Sun Ball in El Paso Texas, the University of
Wisconsin Badgers held off the University of California at Los
Angeles 21-20. The Badger's coach Barry Averett says that his
seniors showed leadership in making their last game one of their
best.

We were soft after that first drop. Sometimes when it comes too easy
you can get soft but I liked the way they responded. This team has
been resilient all year, had a lot of guys down and a lot of people
had to step up and they found a way to win. I'm real proud of them.
