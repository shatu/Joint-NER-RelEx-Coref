at the supreme court tonight -- important questions about medical
testing and privacy rights of individuals. when can doctors tell
police they've discovered evidence their patients are committing
crimes? here's nbc's pete williams. 
<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
it's a case that pits a woman's medical privacy against the state's
desire to protect children. faced with an epidemic of cocaine use by
pregnant mothers who were potentially putting their babies at risk,
the medical staff at this charleston, south carolina, hospital came
up with a novel idea -- decide which of the pregnant where things
went wrong. we need doctors to act like doctors, not doctors to act
like police. 
<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
but the state defends it as a way to get mothers off drugs, reducing
the risk of having unhealthy babies. i went over and looked at these
babies when this case started. we're talking about a 3 1/2-pound
human being. it would make you cry. 
<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
the question for the court -- when can doctors tip off police?
justice scalia said -- doctors routinely report when they find
gunshot wounds. why not when they find proof of drug use? but
justice ginsburg asked -- how can the hospital say it's protecting
unborn children by arresting women after they give birth? many of
the nation's big medical groups oppose the south carolina policy.
they say the threat of arrest will frighten more women away from
pregnancy care, further endangering their babies. if the justices
uphold the south carolina policy, many of the nation's doctors fear
they'll be called on to report more crimes, eroding the trust
between them and their patients. pete williams, nbc news, at the
supreme court.
