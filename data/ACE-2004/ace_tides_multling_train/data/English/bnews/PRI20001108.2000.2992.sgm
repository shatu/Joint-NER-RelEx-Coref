This is the World I am Lisa Mullins. Well we can't tell you won
Florida, but in a moment we will enter the musical question, who let
the dogs out? First up we have the answer to our geo quiz today. We
are looking for a region of central Italy bordering the Adriatic
Sea. The area is mostly mountainous and includes Mt. Corno, the
highest peak of the Apennines. It also includes a lot of sheep, good
clean living, healthy sheep. And an Italian entrepreneur has an idea
about how to make a little money of them. The answer is Abruzzo.
Journalist Carlos Depalazai was in Rome, Italy and Carlo how does
this fellow plan to profit from the sheep of the Abruzzo? 
<TURN>
He is taking advantage of two craze that we are having in the Italy
at the moment, one is Internet, the other one is the awareness on
food. So this guy came up with the idea of having people adopting
sheep by an Internet. So you can have access through your computer
on your desk. Go to the web site of these guys and you can have look
at the face of sheep which are available to be adopted. 
<TURN>
So what does it mean to adopt a sheep, to show up on your back step
or do you, somehow keep track of it's progress on the farm in Italy? 
<TURN>
You are not actually adopting the sheep in the sense that you can
have it with you. It looks like distant adoption, where you don't
actually have the child in your home, you are just contributing with
a certain amount of money and your are monitoring the growing up. It
works in the same way, so you have access on the web site of this
little farm, in a little village of Abrutzi and you can choose among
many, many sheeps and after contributing with a certain amount of
money the sheep is actually yours. 
<TURN>
All right, so the amount of money you have mentioned to us is about
160 US dollars and for that you get more than just a one warm and
fuzzy feeling. You can also receive leggings that are made from wool
of the sheep and even if you like some of the sheep dropping
delivered to your door. 
<TURN>
Yeah, I mean this is quite funny. But I think apart from all the
details, which are sometimes even strange I think what is really
important is that it is a sign of a new concern that is effecting
Italian people. I mean we are notoriously lover of good food. We
have a generous attitude towards food. And this is a new stuff. The
fact that you really care about a sheep in the way she is feed, in
the way she is nurtured, in the way people are looking after it,
because it's a way to ensure that you have something which is
genuine on your table up the end. 
<TURN>
Wait a minute, you said that on your table up the end. 
<TURN>
Yeah, at the table if it becomes food for instance, which is an
option. You are adopting the sheep and whatever happens at the end
it's your choice and among the option is you know food for your
meal. 
<TURN>
That kind of puts a whole new tone to this thing. I mean usually
when you think of this kind of adoption that means saving an animal
not eventually eating it. 
<TURN>
I mean this an option which is available and I think it is a sort of
provocation, you know Italians now mainly live in metropolitan areas
in big cities like Rome, Florence, Naples. In the past, we were a
population of shepherds or farmers. We had completely different
attitude towards nature. It's seems that we are losing something,
and we need to reestablish a better relationship with nature and the
simple fact that the environment minister in Italy supported the
initiative and he himself adopted a sheep is significant. He took
advantage immediately of these ideas to build up a new awareness and
a new attitude of Italians towards nature and farms. 
<TURN>
Carlo De Blazia, journalist speaking to us from Rome. Thank you very
much Carlo. Nice to talk to you. 
<TURN>
Thank you.
