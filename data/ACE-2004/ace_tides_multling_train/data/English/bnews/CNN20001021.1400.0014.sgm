hello, everyone. i'm holly firfer, sitting in for judy fortin.
here's our top story -- as palestinians bury their dead, the
violence in the streets of the mideast continues. and arab leaders
begin a meeting in cairo, trying to develop a unified position on
the whole situation. egyptian president hosni mubarak opened the
emergency arab league summit with a statement blaming israel for
adopting a belligerent attitude which threatens the essence of
peace. palestinian authority president yasser arafat accused israel
of "mass killing and barbarian bombing." he called on the arab
leaders to take a stand "befitting the sacrifices" of the
palestinian people. 
<TURN>
our choice is the choice of permanent, comprehensive and just peace,
and our aim is to liberate our land and to create our independence
state in palestinian blast land with jerusalem as its capital and
the return of our refugees to their homes. 
<TURN>
while leaders and spokesmen for both sides talk, the fighting goes
on. richard blystone reports on the latest round of violence in the
mideast. 
<TURN>
the studied words of the diplomats and the cries in the street seem
to come from two different worlds, fresh clashes in the gaza strip
on the mediterranean coast and in the west bank, fighting springs
from the funerals for at least nine palestinians killed friday in
some of the worst clashes in this three-week conflict. a new
intifada, successor to the four-year street campaign that ended with
palestinian/israeli negotiations a decade ago. according to a leader
of yasser arafat's fateh movement. a counterview from dan meridor,
chairman of israel's defense and foreign affairs committee. 
<TURN>
when i hear the palestinians saying on television we are at the war
of independence of palestine, i understand they prefer war to peace.
a stupid and difficult historic mistake, but we have to face it. 
<TURN>
overnight, a new development on israel's northern border. the
defense reports an attack at the border fence. one body was found
after israelis responded with small arms, tanks and helicopters from
lebanon, the hezbollah movement which waged a war of attrition with
the israelis before they withdrew from south lebanon in may, says
its fighters were not involved. as the weeks wear on, the words of
diplomats and leaders seem more and more irrelevant. reaction
follows reaction. the initiative is in the streets. richard
blystone, cnn, jerusalem. 
<TURN>
the u.n. general assembly has passed a resolution that is critical
of israel's use of force against palestinians. it also condemns
israeli excessive use of force by palestinians. it calls israeli
settlements in the occupied territories illegal and an obstacle to
peace. 46 nations abstained from the vote. six others oppose the
measure, including israel and the united states. they say it sends a
negative message.
