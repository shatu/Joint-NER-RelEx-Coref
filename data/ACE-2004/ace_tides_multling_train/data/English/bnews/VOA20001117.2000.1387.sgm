the Legend of Bagger Vants directed by Robert Redford is the latest
movie to bring the game of golf to the screen and is one of the most
popular attractions of theaters in the United States. Entertainment
reporter Chuck Rich discussed this and previous golf films with
VOA's Dave Arlington.

The movies 'The Natural' and 'Feel The Dreams' brought mystical and
nostalgic qualities to baseball and The Legend of Bagger Vants, set
during the economic depression over the 1920s and 1930s, does the
same thing for golf. Will Smith plays a caddy who revives the
confidence, as well as the skill of a golfer whose glory has faded.
You know I understood everything Will Smith said in films like "Men
in Black" and "Independence Day." What was he talking about there? 
<TURN>
Beats the heck out of me. Seriously, I think golf and many golf
films can be whatever you interpret them to be, what the player or
the moviegoer decides they'll be. Some people consider golf to be a
silly and dull game, following a little ball around the course,
others, including some filmmakers, view it as a symbol or as a gauge
of a person's philosophy or psychology. For example in the 1996
movie "Tin Cup" with Kevin Costner and Cheech Merrin, what might be
an embarrassing experience in one golfers past is for him a badge of
honor. Do you have to like golf to like golf movies? 
<TURN>
It helps, but it's not necessary. Some filmmakers and performers
used golf as a setting for broad comedy with potential appeal both
inside and outside of the sport. The 1996 golf movie "Happy Gilmore"
starring and co-written by Adam Sandler, placed the temperamental
ice hockey player in a professional sport that some people consider
refine. 
<TURN>
Golf can be a very frustrating game. So, any golfer I guess would
understand that gag in "Happy Gilmore." 
<TURN>
And anyone who dislikes or is bored by golf, might appreciate seeing
the game played for laughs there. 
<TURN>
What is your take on golf movies? 
<TURN>
I only play miniature golf and I don't watch golf on television. I
think I am one of the people filmmakers are thinking of, when they
try to give a golf movie wide appeal, humor, or a love story for
example. One film that's attracted a lot of golf loving fans over
the years is 1980s "Caddy Shack". Set at the exclusive Bush Wood
country club, it's about class conflict or as movie advertising
sometimes calls it, the snobs versus the flops. Here is one golfer
in "Caddy Shack" played by Rodney Dangerfield, bothering another, a
judge played by the late Ted Night. 
<TURN>
As a comedian, Rodney Dangerfield often says he gets no respect, but
weren't the filmmakers is really showing their respect for him and
his drawing power by casting him in this film? 
<TURN>
I think Dangerfield was a big selling point who attracted a lot of
his fans, who include me, to see "Caddy Shack." I don't think it's a
very good film, but it's a popular one and the music in "Caddy
Shack" got some attention too. We're going to finish up our
cinematic round of golf with some of that. 
<TURN>
Thank you, Chuck. 
<TURN>
You're welcome, Dave.
