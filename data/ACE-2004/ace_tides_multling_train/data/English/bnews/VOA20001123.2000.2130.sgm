Two more bombs have exploded near Haiti's capital killing a
7-year-old girl and wounding two people in the latest pre-election
violence. On Wednesday, seven bombs exploded around Port-au-Prince.
No group has claimed responsibility for today's blasts. The
government and opposition are exchanging accusations over who is to
blame for a wave of violence ahead of Sunday's presidential
election. I'm Dave Deforest, VOA News.
