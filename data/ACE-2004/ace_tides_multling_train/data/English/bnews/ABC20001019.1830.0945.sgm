as for the animals, when it comes to genetically engineered animals,
the law's having an even tougher time keeping pace with science. a
u.s. company is seeking government permission to bring genetically
all thered fish to america's kitchens. kevin newman reports from a
canadian province. 
<TURN>
for as long as they've told stories, fishermen on this canadian
island province have shared tales of their catch. lobster in recent
years. but not too long ago, another delicacy -- salmon. 
<TURN>
oh, yeah, we used to get salmon in the spring, but we don't see it
anymore. i think they are pretty well wiped out. 
<TURN>
but only two miles away, atlantic salmon are thriving. and that's an
understatement. these experimental salmon are on the cutting edge of
the debate over genetically engineered food because a company has
found a way to make the bigger one use growth hormone more
efficiently. it reaches full-size faster. how old is this fish? 
<TURN>
you're looking at 2 1/2 years. 
<TURN>
how old is this fish? 
<TURN>
same age. 
<TURN>
it is up to the food and drug administration to decide if these will
be the first genetically engineered beings to make it to your dinner
table. but is that agency also capable of judging what impact it may
have on other species? senior government wildlife experts have their
doubts. 
<TURN>
i think it's asking more of the f than it should be asked to turn it
into a wildlife agency. 
<TURN>
the fda says it has hired experts in the field. but unlike wildlife
agencies, the fda keeps its research and evaluations secret from the
public. 
<TURN>
laws do stipulate that there are certain types of material that we
need to hold in confidence. 
<TURN>
which worries some who think it's important people know if creating
supersalmon to feed human appetites could threaten normal salmon. 
<TURN>
we have shown they have a tremendous potential to upset the balance
of nature. 
<TURN>
the company producing the supersalmon says it can solve that problem
by engineering fish that never mate. but the balance of nature grows
more complicated and controversial, the deeper man explores the
power of creation. kevin newman, abc news, souris, prince edward
