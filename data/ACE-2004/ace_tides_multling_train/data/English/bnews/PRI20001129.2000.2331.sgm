I have a number of suggestions to help you through your national
crisis over who should be the next President. 
<TURN>
And The World's Eddie Mair has included them in this week's letter
from London. 
<TURN>
Normally I wouldn't interfere in your politics, at least not since
Hillary Clinton called me and asked whether she should stand in New
York. I advised her there was more chance of Rudy Giuliani being
caught with another woman than there was of her winning elected
office. But your post-election dilemma leads me to put forward a
number of ideas to assist you at this, the most critical moment
Americans have faced since they changed the taste of coke. First of
all, what about allowing Clinton just have a third time? We know
him, he knows us, and it has never been dull. What's more, he enjoys
his special relationship with Britain's Tony Blair, and he has
formed special relationships with, well you set your own White House
intern, joke here. Another way of deciding who should be your next
leader is by putting the word President in front of the candidate's
surnames. If you say President Gore, does it send a shiver up your
spine? And surely the goodness will never have a President Bush.
Certainly that's how I am going to refer to them both for the rest
of this letter. I suggest you try it at home. Alternatively, why not
give the presidency to the candidate who stands in front of the
largest number of flags during his news conferences. Both President
Gore and President Bush have held a flurry of news conferences in
recent weeks and with each one they have increased the number of
Stars and Stripes they use as a backdrop. I think they think it
makes them look patriotic and presidential. Things got out of hand
on Monday night when Al Gore appeared in front of what appeared to
be a dozen Stars and Stripes. It looked like an explosion in a flag
factory. I stopped listening to what he was saying and started
wondering where this would end. By tomorrow I'm confident President
Bush will be wearing a Stars and Stripes suit with matching tie,
shoes, shirt and underwear. On Friday, Gore will come out with his
face painted in patriotic colors and by the weekend George W. Bush
would have changed his name to 'America,' just to prove how American
he really is. Having said that I saw the Canadian Prime Minister
celebrate his re-election in front of a dozen maple leaves, but who
cares about Canada. I'm sorry if all of this sounds like a load of
nonsense which undermines the entire principle of democracy. I know
America would never really stand for that, would you? Till next
time, yours truly, Eddie Mair.
