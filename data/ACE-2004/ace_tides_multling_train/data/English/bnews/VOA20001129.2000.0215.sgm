As in August, communist North Korea is allowing 100 relatives to
travel to South Korea's capital Seoul to visit loved ones they have
not seen for five decades. One hundred South Koreans will be in the
northern capital Pyongyang, to meet their North Korean relatives.
But South Korean officials say media interest for the upcoming event
has dropped substantially. The government has also cut back on cost
and allotted days for the reunions. Officials say they have reduced
the reunion schedule from four days to three and will spend some
$800,000 to bring the families together, compared to the nearly $1.6
million it spent for the August event. Nevertheless, the reunions
represent one of the most tangible signs of thawing between the two
cold war enemies. The North and South Korean leaders agreed to the
reunions as part of a broader reconciliation policy at an
unprecedented summit in June. Alicia Reu, VOA News, Hong Kong.
