well, john, there has been reaction from the bush team. you know,
this decision by the gore campaign, a refusal to concede even if
they do not prevail in the manual recounts under way certainly
carries some political risk. but the gore team tonight defends the
decision, saying that fellow democrats and the public would not only
accept but demand what they call a fair and accurate recount in all
the relevant counties. the bush team, responding quickly saying
there would not be such support and that in that scenario gore could
only be seen as a sore loser. despite the holiday, there is no letup
in the fight for florida. a holiday legal victory to be thankful
for, george and laura bush, all smiles in austin today before a pot
luck thanksgiving meal with their twin daughters and friends. the
texas governor makes time for recreation with a morning jog and
prepares for some fishing at his ranch this weekend. the vice
president out of sight today at his residence, aides saying the
entire family together for a meal and football on tv. while the gore
menu remains a family secret, the bush clan all to happy to share
some of his favorite fare -- jalapeno pecan cornbread stuffing and
coconut cake. for vice presidential candidate dick cheney, turkey in
the hospital with his wife and daughter this afternoon. after
suffering a mild heart attack yesterday, his fourth, doctors say
today he's recovering well. cheney gets a checkup call from governor
bush and still expects to be released as early as tomorrow. and
