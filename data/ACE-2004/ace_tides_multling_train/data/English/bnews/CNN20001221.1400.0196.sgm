the epa has announced new rules to cut truck and bus pollution. they
will apply to new trucks and replacement engines sold beginning in
late 2006. the rules will toughen emission standards and will
require diesel fuel to be made with almost no sulfur. 
<TURN>
anybody who has ever driven behind a large truck or bus knows all
too well the foul smell, the grimey residue of diesel exhaust. the
cloud that follows is not only dirty, smoky, cough inducing, it is a
real threat to our health and environment. premature deaths
including cancers, respiratory illness, acid rain, asthma attacks,
especially in our children. 
<TURN>
the goal is to cut dirty air from trucks and buses by 90% over the
next decade. experts say a reduction like that would be equal to
taking 13 million trucks off the road.
