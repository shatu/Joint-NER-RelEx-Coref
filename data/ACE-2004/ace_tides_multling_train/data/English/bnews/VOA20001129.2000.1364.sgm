A beloved American holiday story comes to the big screen in a
Universal Pictures comic fantasy starring Jim Carey. Alan Silverman
has a look at the first feature film adaptation of Dr. Seuss's "How
the Grinch Stole Christmas." 
<TURN>
The late Theodore Geisel, writing under his pen name Dr. Seuss ,
first published "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" in 1957. An instant
classic, it's the whimsical story of the Grinch, a mean spirited
hairy green creature who menaces the holiday loving Hus, who live in
Whoville, until an innocent child Mary Lu Hu teaches him to find the
joy in life. Famed animator Chuck Jones made it into a television
special, and Dr. Seuss died in 1991 believing that Grinch could
never be made into a movie. But with the blessing of the author's
widow, Director Ron Howard set out to film the fantasy, not as a
cartoon, but with actors in costumes and settings in the spirit of
the book.

Of course the book is a very thin, modern fable and it's great
because it's got this incredible character in it, and themes are
very relatable and very, very contemporary and it's presented in a
funny way. So we knew we had to make a movie that was inspired by
the book. And as we developed it, always knowing that we wanted it
to be funny, we wanted it to still maintain the kind of that
Seussian flavor and we wanted Jim Carey to have a great opportunity
to his thing within the spirit of that great character, the Grinch.
I have always been fascinated with this story, "The Grinch." 
<TURN>
Starter Jim Carey says the Grinch is more than just a cold hearted
character. 
<TURN>
He is the outcast. He is the person who didn't feel like he was part
of the club, and so he gave up and that's what a lot of people do.
They kind of go off and on to hell with the world and all that. And
he is basically a guy who just wants to be part of it, you know? He
just wants to be part of that show, you know, at the heart of it.
His heart changes for that reason, because it's ready to change.
That's what I like about it. All you need is somebody who - some
kind of love, some kind of person who reaches out to you, and goes
like, "I know you want to change, I know you don't want to be that,"
you know, so here is your opportunity, you know, and that's what
Cindy Lou does. 
<TURN>
Carey performs covered head to toe in that green-haired costume. He
sneaks behind exquisitely detailed makeup by Oscar winner Rick
Backer, and even his eyes covered with bright yellow contact lenses,
he hardly looks like the star of 'Dumb and Dumber,' or 'The Truman
show.' 
<TURN>
Oh, you will recognize me. And hopefully, you know, from everything
everybody is telling me, I got to a point where even through the
contacts you saw the Grinch's soul. That's what you are after, as
you know, and it's really just what you project, you know. If they
say "action" and I am still thinking about the suit, I am in
trouble, you know, and that is the one thing I am able to do. I can
act, when you say "action". 
<TURN>
And the Grinch with his grinch feet, ice cold in the snow, stood
puzzling and puzzling. And he puzzled, and puzzled, till his puzzler
was sore. Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before.
Maybe Christmas, he thought, , maybe Christmas perhaps means a
little bit more. 
<TURN>
Anthony Hopkins narrates the Dr. Seuss 's verse. The on-screen cast
of "How the Grinch Stole Christmas," also includes Christine
Beranski and Jeffery Tambor, and introduces young Taylor Mumson as
Mary Lou Hu. Alan Silverman, for the Voice of America, in Hollywood.
