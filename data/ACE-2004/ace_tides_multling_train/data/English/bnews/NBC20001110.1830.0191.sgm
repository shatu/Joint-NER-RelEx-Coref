<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
sources tell us al gore has not made up his mind how far he will
push the effort in florida. certainly what his team they say they
still think they could win. as for the courts, we're told that
decision is not likely to be made until november 17th, when the
final tally is in. 
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
al gore, in a deliberate attempt to publicly relax, in the midst of
tension of the highest order. 
<TURN>
i think we're going to win this game. we were ahead 6-0. so i'm very
optimistic. we're talking about the touch football game. 
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
sources say he and his team are also still optimistic about a win in
the recount, because they believe a manual count will turn up
mistakes in gore's favor. meanwhile, the gore florida team today
asserting there is still a lot of work to be done before naming the
president-elect, 
<TURN>
i hope all americans agree the will of the people, not a computer
glitch should select our next president. 
<TURN>
i think we pledged ourselves to try to keep the rhetoric as low as
possible, given the situation, and try to carey it out in a
professional way.

why? as gore considers his options with his family, advisers say he
and the campaign realize they are operating on two distinct and
delicate tracts -- legal, which they will pursue to keep options
open, and political, which they have to watch carefully as they feel
mounting pressure. friends point out that the man who was so quick
to concede the first time to george w. bush when he thought he lost
and who told aides, "we have to do this right," is not a politician
who would insist on a long, damaging legal process, if it is
determined that's what going to court would mean. bill clinton
called al gore today to talk to him, less to offer advice than
support. finally, friends tell us tonight that gore and his family
are also focused on the they believe depending on what happens, gore
has a strong platform right now from which to launch a presidential
bid in the year 200 had. and that is part of the calculation. tom? 
<TURN>
thanks very much , claire shipman tonight.
