back to the middle east tonight, the truce brokered by president
clinton between israelis and palestinians allegedly is in tatters.
palestinians now talking about a battle for independence. israel
says it may abandon the peace negotiations altogether. nine
palestinians were killed today. more than 70 people have been
wounded. mostly palestinians, but also several israeli soldiers.
abc's bob woodruff is in the palestinian territories tonight. 
<TURN>
violence ripped through almost every major palestinian town today.
the worst was in nablus. four palestinians were shot and killed. in
ramallah, thousands of palestinians rushed the israeli checkpoint,
then faced down israeli guns. from hebron to gaza,he wounded were
carried off so fast it was difficult to count them. as is so often
the case, much of the trouble started with funerals that escalated
into fury. most significant, demonstrators who had been throwing
stones this week, today turned to gasoline bombs. israelis who had
been firing rubber bullets stepped up their use of real ones. this
was supposed to be the day the truce went into effect, when both
sides would call off the violence. but that clearly has not
happened, and here in the streets, peace seems very unlikely.
tonight on israeli television, prime minister barak said we cannot
go on as if nothing happened, and if the demonstrations don't stop,
barak's spokesman said israel will continue to use live ammunition. 
<TURN>
they leave no other way for us but to respond with fire, we'll have
to do this. 
<TURN>
palestinian leaders set their people no longer want a cease-fire,
they want their own country. 
<TURN>
we under occupation and subjugation. the question should be what the
hosni mubarak are they still doing there eight years after the peace
process began. 
<TURN>
it us one of the major questions that was supposed to be addressed
after the stoning and shooting had stopped. it certainly has not
stopped. not yet. bob woodruff, abc news, ramallah.
