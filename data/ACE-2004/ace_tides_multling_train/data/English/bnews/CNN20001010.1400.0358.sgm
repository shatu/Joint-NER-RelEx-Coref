a major turning point in u.s.-china relations. president clinton is
expected to sign a bill today granting china permanent normal trade
relations with the united states. he has invited key members of
congress to a signing ceremony at the white house this afternoon.
the measure will end 20 years of review, and guarantees china the
low tariffs almost all other nations receive. in exchange, china
will open a wide range of markets. that clears the way for beijing
to join the world trade organization. the house passed the bill in
may, the senate last month.
