From NPR News in Washington, I am Corey Flintoff. Israeli army
helicopters rocketed targets in the West Bank and Gaza today
striking close to Yasser Arafat's headquarters and injuring at least
a dozen people. Israel said the attacks were in retaliation for the
killings of at least two Israeli reservers who apparently became
lost in the Palestinian town of Ramallah. They sought refuge with
Palestinian police but were later stabbed to death by a mob that
stormed the police station. The violence dealt another blow to the
peace process. Egypt condemned Israel's attacks today and said it
has the approval of other Arab states to host a summit with the
Palestinians and Israelis only if the violence stops. Dale Gavlak
reports from Cairo.

Foreign minister Amre Moussa said Egypt is angry but this cannot
stop it from taking action from saving the peace process and ending
attacks on the Palestinians. 
<TURN>
We cannot accept what happened today. We cannot accept it under any
circumstances. This is indeed a big blow to the peace process, a big
blow to the relations in the region, a big blow to the stability in
the Middle East. This has to cease. This has to stop and you have to
stop it in a way that would bring together the parties concerned and
get the necessary commitments from both, from them. 
<TURN>
Mussa said Egypt has been in contact with President Clinton about a
meeting to call the parties to examine the situation and turn it
around. He added that Egypt cannot sit tight and let the crisis
continue. For NPR News I am Dale Gavlak in Cairo.
