The City of Los Angeles has announced that it wants to become the
first city to host the Olympics three times. The city that staged
the summer games in 1932 and 1984 is hoping to host the summer games
in 2012. Other US cities expected to submit bids by the December
15th deadline are Dallas, Washington, Baltimore, Cincinnati,
Houston, New York, San Francisco and Tampa, Florida. The US Olympic
Committee will make its choice in late 2002 and the International
Olympic Committee will select the Host City in 2005.
