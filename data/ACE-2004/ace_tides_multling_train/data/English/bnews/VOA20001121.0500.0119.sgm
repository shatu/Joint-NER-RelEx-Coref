As night fell, Israeli combat helicopters fired dozens of missiles
at targets in the Gaza Strip, striking near the office of
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Targets included a police station
and Security Headquarters. Parts of Gaza were plunged into darkness
as electricity went off during the raids. Following the strikes,
Prime Minister Ehud Barak warned Israel would use all force
necessary with no restraints to end weeks of violence. He described
the bombing of a school bus traveling from a Jewish settlement in
the Gaza Strip early Monday, as a barbaric and terrorist act, and
said no negotiations were currently underway with the Palestinian
leadership. Earlier, the Palestinian authority issued a statement
denying involvement in the school bus attack. Palestinian leaders
accused Israel of choosing a path of war by launching the strikes
and called for international intervention. Eve Connan, VOA News,
