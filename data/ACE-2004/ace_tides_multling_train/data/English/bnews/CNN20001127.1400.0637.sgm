in november of 1997, barbie gets a makeover to give her a more
youthful and contemporary look. toymaker mattel, inc. refined
barbie's gravity-defying proportions by slimming her bust and hips
and widening her waist, as well as giving her a new nose. barbie
millicent roberts, named after the daughter of a mattel co-founder,
hit store shelves in 1959. the buxom bombshell of a doll underwent
two face-lifts in 1967 and 1977, but critics continued to charge
that her abundant curves presented an unrealistic body ideal for
young girls. the 1997 makeover made barbie less busty and a little
thicker around the middle. she's also doing her part for medical
science. plastic knee joints from retired dolls are now used to make
knuckles in prosthetic fingers for amputees at duke university
medical center. the plastic princess has had more than 75 careers,
including rock star, astronaut and presidential candidate. with
"headliners," i'm bob glascoff.
