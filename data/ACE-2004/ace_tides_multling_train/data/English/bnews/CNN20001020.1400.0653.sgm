a one-time federal judge who has seen the law from both sides of the
bench is now hoping to keep his job making laws. bob glascoff has
the story in today's edition of "headliners." 
<TURN>
on october 1989, judge alcee hastings is convicted of perjury and
conspiracy and impeached by the senate. appointed to the federal
bench in 1979, he was charged two years later with conspiracy to
accept a bribe in a case he presided over in miami. he was acquitted
by a jury in 1983, but a panel of judges reopened the case four
years later, accusing him of both the original crime and lying about
it under oath. the house impeached him and the senate convicted and
removed hastings from office in 1989. three years later, his
conviction was reversed. two months after that, he was elected to a
newly drawn district in ft. lauderdale. he is currently serving his
fourth term in office and is up for re-election this fall. with
