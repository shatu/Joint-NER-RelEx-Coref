Thank you very much Bob. There could be verdicts today in three
different court cases relating to the State's contested Presidential
election in Florida and the verdicts are believed to comprise Vice
President Al Gore's last chance to win the White House by reversing
George W Bush's Election Day victory. Corespondent Nick Semion
reports from Tallahassee where the most closely watched ruling could
come from Florida's Supreme Court. 
<TURN>
Florida's highest court must decide whether to overturn a strongly
ordered lower court decision that firmly rejected Vice President
Gore's request for a hand recount of thousands of . The Bush
campaign says this would amount to rewriting Florida election law
and that no evidence exists that any voter was denied the right to
cast the ballot. In two separate cases, lower courts are considering
a demand by pro-Gore voters that thousands of absentee ballots be
thrown out because Republican party workers were allowed to adjust
ballot applications. Bush campaign Attorney Matthew Staber says the
solution should not be to penalize the wrong people. 
<TURN>
When we look at the remedy that they are requesting. Even the
disenfranchisement of one voice in this case is a price too high to
pay. 
<TURN>
While all this is going on, the Republican leaders of Florida's
legislature begin a special session Friday, to appoint the State's
25 electors a move designed to ensure that George W Bush is
guaranteed enough electoral votes to win the White House. Dick
Semion, VOA News, Tallahassee.
