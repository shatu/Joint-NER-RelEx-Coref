And at one forty-five Universal time you are listening to the Voice
of America. Monkey experiments by an international research team
have reversed the brain degeneration typical of Parkinson's disease
by placing repair proteins inside a disabled AIDS virus. As we hear
from David McAlary, the work is being hailed as a break through in
an effort to end Parkinson's deterioration. 
<TURN>
Patients with advanced Parkinson's are easy to spot. Degeneration of
brain cells or neurons causes them to shake, shuffle and stoop. The
neurons produce less and less of the chemical dopamine that helps
relay signals between them. Dopamine replacement with drugs is the
main therapy but it loses effectiveness as the disease progresses.
The next step is transplanting nerve tissue from a fetus to replace
the lost dopamine neurons. But that is a costly, risky surgery. Now
a US-Swiss-French group has successfully tested a third approach in
monkeys, one that delivers the seeds of a dopamine neuron
nourishment protein directly to the brain by injection. 
<TURN>
It works as a protectant of the cell so to stop the disease in its
tracks. 
<TURN>
This is study leader Jeffery Codover of Rush Presbyterian St. Lukes
Medical Center in Chicago. The stimulating brain protein his team
used is called GDNF. Previous studies have shown that GDNF keeps
dopamine cells healthy but the problem has been getting it to the
brain. As a defense, the brain's blood vessels prevent most
compounds from entering from the blood stream making it difficult to
design a Parkinson's drug. To overcome this, Mr. Codover's team
injected a gene to make GDNF right into the monkey's brains. To
transport the gene, Louisiane University researchers devised an HIV
virus stripped of its infecting machinery. When they injected the
altered virus into brains of aging animals with early Parkinson's it
conveyed the attached GDNF gene efficiently, causing dopamine cells
to produce the rescue protein on site. 
<TURN>
When we delivered GDNF via gene therapy in these aged monkeys we
were able to completely reverse all the cellular changes,
degenerative changes that are seen in aged monkeys as they relate to
Parkinson's disease. 
<TURN>
The researchers report in the journal Science that the gene therapy
also restored coordinated movement in young monkeys in which
Parkinson's was chemically induced. The benefits of the treatment
appear permanent or at least very long lasting as GDNF genes
continually produce the rescue protein. Mr. Codover says that in
people, it would be tested as preventive therapy rather than one for
existing symptoms. 
<TURN>
Most current clinical trials in Parkinson's disease are directed
towards symptomatic therapy or towards more advanced patients. This
type of therapy is directed towards more early patients with the
emphasis on preventing the progression of the disease rather than
replacing lost neurons or more symptomatic types of benefits. 
<TURN>
In Stockholm, Sweden Carolinska Institute neuroscientist Lars Olson
says if gene delivery works well in people, it would be the best
Parkinson's treatment yet. 
<TURN>
It would be better because you wouldn't have to take medication and
you wouldn't have to do cell transplantation either. It might be a
treatment that you would have to do only once or perhaps a few times
during life with the illness. 
<TURN>
Mr. Olson says the treatment might also be applied to other brain
diseases in which nerve cells degenerate. But he warns of a major
hurdle in assuring patients get the proper dose of gene therapy
because too much is bad. 
<TURN>
If you over-stimulate other neighboring dopamine neurons you might
get side effects similar to some of the symptoms seen is
schizophrenia for instance. For use in patients one would like to
have a system where the activity of the delivered gene could be
controlled. 
<TURN>
Jeffery Cooover says he is now testing ways of regulating gene
delivery in monkeys. He hopes to try the procedure in people within
five years following US government review. David McAlary, VOA News,
