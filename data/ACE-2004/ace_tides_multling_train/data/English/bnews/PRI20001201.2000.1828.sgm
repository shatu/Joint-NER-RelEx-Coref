Supreme Court has held a hearing to decide whether to intervene in
the dispute over the presidential election results. Judith Spencer
reports on the legal wrangling that is underway.

Inside the stately Supreme Court building, lawyers for Republican
George W. Bush and Democrat AL Gore argued over the validity of hand
re-counts in the crucial state of Florida, just as Ruth Bater
Ginsburg pressed Bush's lawyer to explain why the Federal High Court
should intervene in the Florida Supreme Court's move to extend the
deadline for finishing the re-counts.

When we read a State court decision, we should read it in the light

by the Florida court. 
<TURN>
The US Supreme Court could rule on the matter as early as tomorrow.
For The World, I am Judith Spencer in Washington.

appeal from Al Gore for an immediate re-count of thousands of
disputed ballots from Palm Beach and Miami Dade counties.
